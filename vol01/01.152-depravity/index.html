They were near the castle now. She could almost hear the pennants.</p><p>And across that field stood the Emperor and orcs flanking him. These orcs were better armed, looked harder. Elites.</p><p>Ella stood up, despite the hiss from Zaidu, she could feel her crown settle on her head and that ethereal connection to the crown of the Emperor. it felt clearer now that they were closer, she could feel the tug of war in power.</p><p>Her face smiled behind the mask and she gave a strong &ldquo;pull&rdquo; on the tether and watched the crown on the Emperor dim. did his eyes narrow in surprise? She couldn&rsquo;t tell across the field, but she thought so.</p><p>They could have stared at one another daring the other to speak as if such meaningless political games meant anything here, but Ella knew they did not.</p><p>&ldquo;My Emperor,&rdquo; her voice was hoarse from smoke and yelling on the battlefield. Her tone was mocking in its supposed sincerity. She swept a curtsy, looking ridiculous in torn and bloody tactical gear.</p><p>The Emperor thought they were playing the game and I coined his head and nodded as if he was receiving his due.</p><p>He spoke quietly but the waves of sound were subtly sustained, reverberating through the air without decay.</p><p>&ldquo;Our wayward princess returns. We welcome the return of our Dagger and hope to save you from yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why would I need saving?&rdquo;</p><p>The Emperor stood across from her, regarding her. His eyes glowed in the distance much like hers. His stance was proud, his posture straight, so different from that time not so long ago in the throne room.</p><p>&ldquo;We see you do not know. Have you stumbled onto both Appropriation and Investituture unknowingly?&rdquo;</p><p>He began to laugh in a way that didn&rsquo;t match the formality of his previous speech.</p><p>&ldquo;Our young foolish princess. You have been partaking in the blessing of the Aqrabuamelu, eating the dead and taking their strength, their vitality&mldr; and their cruelty.&rdquo; He was stumbling through the laughter to get the words out. it grated on her.</p><p>&ldquo;And to compound it further, you took that cruelty, that anger, that coarsening of morality, and began to Invest it into that mask you wear. It is nascent and when you wear it you will be powerful but far, far more vicious than I have ever been.&rdquo;</p><p>The person that had been Ella but was mostly the mask knew it was true somewhere. Over these past few weeks, she had been screaming inside. That voice was just distant though, a hollowed echo of the truth of what she was now.</p><p>&ldquo;For all your bravado, you are turning yourself into another monster to defeat us, much like the others&mldr;&rdquo; The Emperor mused, almost to himself.</p><p>Ella stood there in equipoise with the mask she wore. The truth had forced the acknowledgement of how she needed the power she had put into the mask, the ability she had with it and the viciousness had gotten her this far. But the horrible acts she had committed had eaten her soul. Pulling it off now would reveal that more than anything and weakly she could not do it.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you even in there, we wonder?&rdquo;</p><p>The mask stood there quietly. Was she trembling a bit?</p><p>A sudden torrent of force appeared, a battering ram of air slammed Ella and the surrounding area, She had been too distracted with her inner turmoil and went flying back. She could feel her ribs break under the pressure as she landed in the ground and the force pinned her down.</p><p>The other Aqrabuamelu were sent flying back. Several were pulped into mere splatters of sinew and blood. Zaidu, consummate warrior that he was, somehow leaped into the air to ride out the force being sent tumbling backwards. Arcsa was hit on the side and his leg flattened into a paste. Others died and were maimed.</p><p>The effect was so great that nobody noticed the Emperor&rsquo;s slight stumble from the power he had brought to bear. He strode forward to stand over the pinned Ella, flat on her back and bearing untold pressure pushing her into the ground.</p><p>He did not speak but pointed a finger at her and the pressure on her increased again. The mask was pushing against her face and she could feel the skin underneath begin to tear and blood began to pour from the eyeholes and around the sides.</p><p>It began to crack down the middle and the magic bound in it leaked out and mixed with the blood.</p><p>Ella couldn&rsquo;t think, the pressure was intense, the pain excruciating. And she couldn&rsquo;t see, her vision clotted with blood and the effort to stay conscious.</p><p>There was something, a weapon she had saved at the ready. Something too powerful to use, but in desperation she reached for it, pure creation and destruction as a small thread of antimatter was brought into the world, it appeared as a small ball between them, and instantly reacted in annihilation, the explosion throwing eh Emperor away and the pressure suddenly released.</p><p>It all went black.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class='container sep-before'></div></footer></article><article lang=en class=entry><div class='container entry-content'></div></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class='prev-entry sep-before'><a title="Previous page in vol01" href=/vol01/01.151-feral/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
