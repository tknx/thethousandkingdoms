This is where I think I will really lose any of the sticklers physicists since I clearly have no idea what I am talking about.  So I ask for their forbearance and even dialogue around it. 

This chapter was also way too much exposition and nothing much has happened for a few chapters. I am unsure how balance the peaks and valleys since this is a serial and I didn't plot those all in advance.  I suppose I should be applying the lessons of Blake Snyder's [Save The Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need](https://amzn.to/3JBWiHK) book to give it that MCU flavor.   Obviously then I need a villain that is a mirror opposite of Ella, right?

Anyway my goal of people acting rational but not like robots and having them have competing priorities is part of this. Ella has been focused on self defense, which makes sense. But that isn't all there is, nor is it playing to her strengths.
