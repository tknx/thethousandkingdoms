###    Two weeks later (Thursday, April 14, 2022)
####   Financial District, Manhattan, New York, United States

Donna was walking by a garage at night when an unknown number texted her to take a turn into the garage.

She looked around and then slowly made her way in, cautious. 

But when she saw the tall, cadaverous disguise of Kothin there, she relaxed. 

"What do you want?"

"I need you to go to South America and get it." Kothin's voice was strange and almost a bit distant, but the wail of a police car siren and reflection of itsflashing lights distracted her. 

She was about to ask why. And then Kothin said, "The Emperor asks it of you. Find it."

Donna dropped to her knees. "I will do God's will. May I kill the girl before I go? She consorts with the traitors, the scorpions must be destroyed."

"Do you question the Emperor's commands?"

"God is all, and I do all for God."

"Go... and I do not want to hear from you until you have it."

Kothin walked away into the shadows. Donna stood up and waited and then walked away in a different direction. 

After twenty minutes, Bahu and Ella came out from the utility closet. The light above having been strategically sabotaged several days in advance. 

"It was harder to do the sound. The police car was an inspired distraction." Ella said. Her face was clammy from sweat. That illusion had taken a lot from her, the darkened garage required to hide the fraying edges of the illusion. But that was nothing compared to speech. She had used a hidden speaker to carry the disguised voice of an Aqrabuamelu whose voice sounded the closest to Kothin. It had almost failed.

The scorpions reported as Donna went to the studio she kept, packed some bags and arranged for flight tickets. They had arranged a series of handoffs to avoid suspicion and even set numerous spotters on alternate paths.  

But she packed her bags and got into a car and went to JFK. 

"She has bought tickets for tomorrow's morning flight. We will have an agent on the plane." Bahu reported. 

"So what now?"

"Now we go as well. We have one squad there but we want to get the relic into your hands as soon as possible. The risks are too high once it is found."

They had no choice but to wait until the next flight which was in the evening, the risk of running into Donna as she landed in the airport was too high without some space. 

The day was tense. The flight was approximately ten hours long so Donna would be landing just as they went. 

Packing was difficult. No weapons, no tactical gear. Ella packed functional hiking gear in dark colors into her backpack, just another kid traveling through South America.

They were two hours into their evening flight, Ella still not managing to fall asleep when an email came to her phone.  Ella had been reading a text on reproductive cellular mechanics which she only just got the gist of. 

She opened the email and saw that it was from Arcsa. And encrypted. She spent time trying to remember how to decrypt the email and eventually got it sorted. 

The two squads on the ground in South America, one in Atacama near thee mines and the other in Buenos Aires, had been eliminated. They must have been spotted and compromised beforehand. 

The agent on the plane with Donna reported that Donna had used the airplane phone freely most of the flight, but using a drow language. It was as good as Navajo during World War II without magic being available to translate. 

Arcsa's instructions were clear. The mission was off. Ella and team were to deplane and immediately go two gates over to catch a plane leaving for Mexico City. From there an Aqrabuamelu team from Juarez would come down to meet them and provide security while they determined what else had been compromised. 

Ella was fuming. She was not going to lose this one chance to find out what had been going on in South America.  After a moment's thought, she fired back a message asking what knowledge the South American teams had. 

When Arcsa replied that they had set up safehouses at both locations and arms, but hadn't been briefed on Ella arriving, Ella made a decision. She wasn't giving up the opportunity. Two emails later and Arcsa acquiesced.   

Reinforcements were scrambling from Los Angeles and New York.  But for at least twelve hours, Ella's team would be on their own. They would also be arriving unarmed. An attempt to charter a private plane was being made but was questionable. 

Their arms dealers in South America had to be assumed to be compromised. Ella sent a query to find out who the Aqrabuamelu had found unsuitable to deal with, as they were now the best option. 

The agent on the plane with Donna was a private investigator and thought he was on a divorce case. They had one consultant, an ex-Chilean Lautaro special forces soldier. But the assumption was that he was a Chilean intelligence asset and not to be trusted either. 

The plan was to find somewhere to hole up, contact various weapon dealers to get some armament, and the others would scout for Donna. Ella was too well known to be seen out there. 

Ella looked around at her plane flight. If Donna knew she was here, if Kothin did, could they attack the plane itself? Thus far they had no sense of Ekerri's resources. He had not taken the field himself nor shown his hand. And then some turbulence hit and Ella almost threw up from fear. An old grandmotherly lady offered her a bag from the seat back but Ella held it together. 

They landed and Ella waited to disembark until the others had checked for anyone else. The flight had gotten in half an hour early and the international terminal was relatively empty. 

Ella tied her hair back and tucked it into her shirt.  She bought a tacky cap from one of the tourist stores and went to the bathroom to surreptitiously beat it up and make it look worn.  Remembering something from a book, she took two sticks of gum, chewed them, and then tucked them high into her cheeks to change the shape of her face.

Davcina and Adra ran point, pretending to be a couple. Ella and Etana were another couple.  Tauthe kept the rear guard. 

They exited the terminal and Ella almost froze when she detected a wisp of magic coming from a Carabineros officer.  Ella discretely motioned to Tauthe who started making a scene in loud English. Ella got in a taxi with Etana and told the driver a fancy hotel while Davcina and Adra split up. 

Ella messaged, this was at least one lead.  And so Davcina and Adra began tracking the disguised officer. 

Ella and Etana got to the hotel and requested a large suite. The hotel was still relatively empty and eager to please them and they managed to get a room on a mostly empty floor. They then broke into the room across the hall and waited. 

Ella finally called Arcsa. He spent about five minutes yelling at her for taking the risk. She finally got a chance to brief him. Midway through she remembered the gum tucked up in her cheeks and spit it out. Her cheeks felt stretched out and strange. 

Bahu and Zaidu were both en route on the next flight along with some other soldiers. They had significant cash with them. The private investigator had been deemed too risky to continue and they had him on a flight back to New York.  Another two teams were coming from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires.

They had two shipping containers loaded with gear being sent by sea, and the team from Juarez was literally driving down in a couple of vans, but was at least two weeks out.

Attached was a list of three arms dealers that the Aqrabuamelu had decided against dealing with when they had a presence down in South America. Only one was in Santiago so that made the choice relatively easy. 

Arcsa told her to hold tight for Babu and the others.

And then Davcina called. Ella joined her into the video call. 

"We followed the police officer for another hour.  After most of the US flights had landed, he was relieved by another officer. Adra is staying with the second officer. I followed the first one to a small warehouse in Maipú and I am currently outside of it. I've seen several other people go in and out, but nobody matching the description you gave me of Donna."

Ella thought for a moment, "So that officer is almost certainly another drow. You should come back, the risk of discovery is too high. I wonder if the replacement officer is also a drow?  If I was there, I could sense magic but without that this is our only lead."

"Drow traditionally work either solo or in pairs," Arcsa said. "Let's assume that there are two there plus Donna. So you have three potential leads."

Ella felt like she was bouncing off the wall quickly enough. The enforced inactivity was too much and she went down to the hotel gym to exercise and think. She came back and Davcina was back. Adra had reported that he had caught the second officer talking to his wife on the phone and was considering that good enough for now. Ella couldn't fault the judgment there. 

"I will bet they will be there again in the evening when the next batch of US planes comes in. We should let Bahu and Zaidu know. And call Tauthe and have her get us a couple of SIM cards."

Tauthe eventually showed up, she had deliberately taken a long route back to the hotel and gotten a room on a different floor under her name. 

Ella put in the SIM card and then called Arcsa and while he was on, texted the arms dealer to set up a meet tonight. 

She thought about how to word it and ended up settling on a pithy and non-specific language. 

    {{<lang es "I want to buy">}}Quiero comprar.{{</lang>}} 

The response came back soon enough

    {{<lang es "Who is it?">}}¿Quien es?{{</lang>}}

Ella looked at the sheet of notes she had made to cover for her terrible Spanish. 

    {{<lang es "A friend of Raul and Tito">}}Una amiga de Raúl y Tito.{{</lang>}}

The codewords were years old. Ella waited nervously. After a pause another response. 

    {{<lang es "Good. What do you need?">}}Bien. ¿Que necesitas?{{</lang>}}

Ella looked at the list and prepared responses for a moment. This was it. 

    20 Glock, 20 {{<lang es "horns, slang for AK-47s">}}cuernos{{</lang>}}, 20 {{<lang es "bulletproof vests">}}chalecos antibales{{</lang>}}

The response was swifter this time. 

    {{<lang es "Do you want to start a war? I have Glocks and Galil's, not AKs or vests">}}¿Quieres empezar una guerra? Tengo glock y galil. No cuernos o chalecos.{{</lang>}} 

It didn't matter, they were going to take whatever they could get. They went on to pick a meeting point and a price. Ella didn't trust any of it. 

Arcsa came back, "He will change the meet point at the last minute to avoid setups. I am betting they will have a hidden gunman or two. This is a terrible idea."

Ella looked at Arcsa on the screen. He looked tired. She felt tired too. 

"It is a terrible idea. But it is what we need."

Arcsa replied, "It is bad to need something. You end up compromising yourself," and he cut the connection. 

Ella, to her surprise, managed to get some sleep and woke up when Bahu was on the ground with her team.
