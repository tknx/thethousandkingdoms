"Eleanor, the captured soldiers are downstairs. What would you have us do with them?" The High Priestess asked her. 

"Take me to them. I want to talk with them."

They walked down into the labyrinth underneath the compound. Ella had finally gotten a hang of the tunnels. Apparently the Aqrabuamelu had been using scent trails this entire time to know where to go. She had been forced to memorize the layout but now she had it. 

When they reached the holding chambers, she looked in on Ansheth. He had been given chambers, still locked, where he paced like a caged animal speaking under his breath. Ella could only catch the occasional imprecations about false gods and vengeance. She didn't know what to do with him anymore. She could spot the magic signature of the drow, and she had learned how to hide her magic from their very keen magical sight. 

Should she have him killed? It was one thing to do it in combat.

Instead, when she came down here, she had started picking at his mind. Looking for the religious programming. But it was so very difficult, the brain was a mess of interconnections and the only thing she had been able to determine was the programming was structurally imposed, not magically. It was part and parcel of the actual brain formation and would not be as easy as the Aqrabuamelu's infertility knot. 

A few rooms over, there were a set of cells that housed the soldiers. 

"Have they said anything?" she asked. 

"No. Just that they were given the objective, to take you family, preferably alive, and a huge bonus to operate on public soil."

"On the left is former Petty Officer Second Class Eli Nelson. Formerly member of the Naval Special Warfare Group 3 until he was drummed out in 2007 for sexual assault. The other is a former member of the 75th Ranger Regiment out of Fort Benning, Captain Daniel Sonenberg, served with distinction until he was caught fraternizing with white supremacist groups."

"Both winners then I see." Ella thought for a moment. 

"Let me talk to the Captain."

---

"Captain Sonenberg, do you know who I am?"

"Eesha Jindal-Witten. Primary target of our mission."

Well this was different than how television had prepped her. Wasn't it supposed to be name, rank and serial number?

"Who issued the orders?"

"I received them from my boss, Major Whittaker at Kenaz."

"Can I ask why you are being so forthcoming?"

"I saw what they did to Private Russell. He died and they carved him up, right outside our cells and starting cooking him. I don't know who you all are, ma'am. But they definitely didn't tell us elite cannibal soldiers were part of it."

Fuck. Ella had forgotten. No, she had deliberately put out of her mind the Aqrabuamelu's distasteful habits. 

"Where did the SIG MCX Spears come from? They just won the next-gen squad weapon contract. They aren't in production yet."

"Don't know ma'am. We were just issues them when the orders were given and had two weeks to get used to them."

"Don't call me ma'am. I know what you really think of me."

"What?"

"I know why you were discharged, Captain."

"Oh that..."

"Yes that."

"Ma'am. Look. I made a mistake back then. I was young and stupid and didn't know any better. Hell I volunteer at a program to help pull people out of that."

"What about Kenaz?"

"The place is lousy with white supremacists," Captain Sonenberg admitted. "I get shit on because my wife is Guatemalan. But fuck them."

Well shit. This wasn't easy. Ella might have been more inclined to have him put to torture otherwise. 

"Who is the real boss of Kenaz?"

"David Marr."

#### Sagaponack, Long Island, New York, United States

David regarded the gaunt figure in front of him. The person sitting acrosss from him, Kothin, looked disreputable even in his suit, he was tall and gaunt with stringy hair and strange mannerisms. A foreigner of some sort althought it wasn't quite clear where. David's people had failed to find out much more.

On the screen was Madeleine Senner, she was trying to argue with Kothin in that horrible shrill voice of hers. This Kothin person didn't seem phazed and simply sat there nodding along insincerely.

Where was her husband anyway? He could keep her in line. She had been terrible back at school at Le Rosey, and she was terrible now.

"Be quiet Maddie. He is my guest here." David turned to Kothin. "Mr. Kothin. I am not sure how it is done from wherever you are from, but let us have a drink and toast to our new business venture."

"David Marr - you do not tell me to be quiet!" Madeleine turned her ire against him. "I am not going to invest in this without him answering more questions. Why does he need so many weapons? I already got burned once on this ridiculous insurrection nonsense, and all for that oaf. I already have my men in the right places."

"That is just fine Madeleine. See you later." David hung up the video call. He would undoubtedly pay for that, but Madeleine and her bought judges weren't reliable. Those pesky lifetime appointments meant they tended to get ideas above their station.

After that, he really did need a drink and he walked over and poured a glass of brandy. A hefty pour for each of them and he handed over the crystal glass to his guest.

"As I was saying, Mr. Kothin. I am happy to provide you with what you need. But I think we will need to understand exactly what will happen and how. This new administration will be hamstrung in the next few months anyway after midterms."

Kothin sat back. "Your class live in fear. Fear of the people waking up and realizing what you have denied them. Fear that they will wake up, that even your uneducated, propagandized mobs will become fickle. And yet, in that fear, you accumulate more wealth, buy more power, squeeze harder." Kothin's hands were white on the glass which Everett had handed him.

"And one day," the glass shattered. Blood dripped from Kothin's hand onto Everett's lion skin, the one he had caught himself ten years ago.

"Damn it man, are you okay?"

Kothin looked at him, not even acknowledging the blood. "Grasp too tightly, and it will cut you. Yet you are too afraid to let go. Too afraid and too greedy."

Everett called his man in to have him clean up and bandage Kothin who took no notice of the sudden flurry of servants coming in and out.

His hand was wrapped up and the servants having left, Kothin got up and poured himself another drink which he downed in one go.

How dare this ignorant savage come and lecture him? "You are wrong. I am not afraid. The idiots out there are stupid, easily led, and would rather die than admit they were fooled. A million and a half of them died in the last three years because we told them not to get a vaccine."

Everrett had once been the voice of moderation among his set. He had actually been afraid that people would get angry. He never thought they could have pushed this far, and it looked like they would go even further in the next two years. It had changed his entire thinking. 

"I just like to hedge my bets. Your offer was interesting, the trinkets you provided got my attention. But before I provide weapons in the numbers you have asked for, I have to ensure my interests are advanced."

"Yes. I can understand that. Our interests do align here. My patron was very impressed with you out of all those who came to meet him."

a

"Is that enough?" Kothin said to the air.

"Yes, his mind is simple. I have enough."

Everett looked down to see a sword, a god-damned sword, coming out of his chest. He died quickly.

"What a foul mind this one had," observed Ekerri, "so worried about his wealth and the purity of his 'race'. He thought the word {{<lang "de" "Literally overhuman, but used by the Nazi's to refer to racial purity" >}}Ãœbermensch{{</lang>}} at least ten times. As if one of one pig is better than another, as if he was more than lucky."

Ekerri smiled, "This society the humans have built rewards this. Power without any purpose besides the accumulation of more power. Irrational hatreds based on superficiality. And look what they have done to my poor world. Once I have this magic the girl has, I will have to waste a fair amount of it just cleaning up this mess. Even if I don't wipe out the humans, his kind is not needed. What a waste."

Kothin had never challenged the Emperor. But something made him ask, "And why do you accumulate power, my lord?"

Ekerri looked in surprise at Kothin. Was that rebuke in his voice? Perhaps Kothin's loyalty had not weathered the millennia. But it did deserve an answer. 

"Before you were born the People warred. I was elected chieftain among my people, the Al'tal, and was a bit more successful than most. I soon realized nobody had the right vision. We could have peace. But it would take a strong hand. Everything else follows."

"Everything else follows," intoned Kothin. He shouldn't have asked. 

He dug into the interior jacket pocket of the suit and handed Ekerri another ring.

Ekerri looked at the ring and laughed, "We made millions of these. Who could believe these pieces of jewelry, leftover toys for children, would play such an important role for the People now? But they will not need to hide much longer."

Ekerri took the ring in his hand and concentrated, fixing the image in his head.

When he slipped it on, he was now an middle-aged human, gut gone to paunch, with beady blue eyes and grey, thinning hair. An exact picture of Everett Marr.

"Strip him for his clothes for me and clean this up. It was a good touch bleeding on the floor in advance to hide this. I'll say you got some of your blood on the shirt."

Ekerri turned to Kothin, "Why didn't you just poison him?"

"He was irritating."

Ekerri turned to regard himself in a mirror. "Is this handsome for a human? They are all alike to me."
