But most likely she is a drow spy which means absolutely dedicated.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could we feed her disinformation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. And that is a good use of a discovered enemy spy. But&mldr; what would you tell her that would get her to lead you to what we want?&rdquo;</p><p>Ella thought for a moment, &ldquo;What if I revealed to her what she already knows? The crown part at least. Let her think I trust her. Then say I am looking for other things and think I know where one might be. Maybe drop that it is in South America.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. You want to run a confidence scam? Is your acting good enough? How long do we think it would take? Would she go running off or just stick to you and call in other assets?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it.&rdquo;</p><p>Getting to whatever was waiting in South America was tough. Arcsa had sent several soldiers to begin methodical searching, but the area to search was huge. He had even infiltrated a few soldiers into the mining operation as laborers. But they all reported nothing.</p><p>Neither Donna nor Kothin&rsquo;s usual disguise as the tall, cadaverous man had made an appearance. They could have other disguises but that felt unlikely given they thought they remained undiscovered.</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it. We have an advantage, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it.&rdquo;</p><p>Bahu smiled beatifically, &ldquo;We have many options and only one chance. It is tough situation, but the right decision will come. I believe in providence.&rdquo;</p><p>At least she didn&rsquo;t say she believed in Innana&rsquo;a providence, thought Ella. Since she had blessed Bahu, she had to deal with a bit more veneration than she felt comfortable with. Or perhaps it was her promise to help the Aqrabuamelu.</p><p>But her promise, was it the right thing? The Aqrabuamelu were not &lsquo;good&rsquo;. They were cannibals, something that Ella doggedly shied away from thinking too much about. They were soldiers non-pareil, but would serve both sides in a war to refine their skills. They were brutal and sadistic, and they were a dying race.</p><p>Ella wondered, if she fully took on the mantle of their goddess, could she reform them? She had read a lot about public policy and justice and thought about what made a good ruler. What was right for both them and the world?</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Going to head back &mdash; I have a&mldr; date.&rdquo;</p><hr><h4 id=charlies-flat-tribeca-new-york-city-united-states>Charlie&rsquo;s flat, TriBeCa, New York City, United States</h4><p>Ella took out some clothes. And then shoved them back in the closet.</p><p>She took out another set of clothes. And then a third.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>&ldquo;Those are fuck-me underwear,&rdquo; Charlie observed from the bedroom door.</p><p>Ella spun around low and to the side in startlement, &ldquo;Damn it Charlie, you could knock.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ride &rsquo;em cowgirl.&rdquo; Charlie said, in that same dry voice. Not bothered at all by Ella&rsquo;s overcharged reflexes.</p><p>Ella looked down and flushed. Grabbed a long t-shirt and put it on.</p><p>&ldquo;This is not a date!&rdquo; she said angrily. &ldquo;We are meeting up to discuss a bit more about me as I promised him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Umm-hmmm,&rdquo; Charlie said, now nosing through her closet. She pulled out a ivory linen wrap dress and threw it on the end. &ldquo;Wear this. And this.&rdquo; A wide belt followed the dress on the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;It needs a shirt underneath. And leggings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it? Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck&mldr;&rdquo; But Ella put it on. And then Charlie came over and pulled the wrap open on her chest a bit more.</p><p>&ldquo;Charlie!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So where is your not-a-date meeting going to be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Socarrat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Socarrat&mldr; hmmm. You mean that lovely,
candle-lit Spanish restaurant with shared paella dishes and live flamenco music on Tuesdays? What day is it today?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tuesday.&rdquo; Ella&rsquo;s voice was very small.</p><p>Charlie threw down some earrings and a necklace on the bed. &ldquo;This should give you a nice Boho vibe. Obviously the music is just to cover up your discussion, right?&rdquo; Ella felt her skin flush.</p><p>&ldquo;Now get dressed and let me do your makeup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Charlie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes dear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fuck you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh honey, you&rsquo;ll just have to settle for the cowboy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ndash;</p><h4 id=west-village-manhattan-new-york-city-united-states>West Village, Manhattan, New York City, United States</h4><p>Isaac kept his eyes rigidly on Ella&rsquo;s face. It was almost comical. He had glanced down once, blushed a little bit, and then rigidly not looked again.</p><p>It was kind of endearing. Apparently he was all kinds of smooth at the bar, but maybe not so much now.</p><p>&ldquo;You look great.&rdquo; He stammered.</p><p>Ella mentally put a victory notch in the air. Even if she felt absolutely, ridiculously underdressed.</p><p>And then she was mentally cursing even more when she sat down. The belt rode up pulling the very short dress up. The wrap wouldn&rsquo;t stay tight and Ella had to surreptitiously pull it from the side to keep from flashing Isaac.</p><p>She set her handbag down with a heavy, metal clank and Isaac frowned. &ldquo;You carrying?&rdquo;</p><p>She nodded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare not.&rdquo; She could feel her boot knife hanging in the suede heeled boots she was wearing. And her coat was her armored one. She had declined checking the coat and had it on the seat next to her. She still felt unprepared.</p><p>He had been surprised when she had asked for a different table than the desirable one in the window and pointed to a booth in the corner.</p><p>And now he had no problem focusing on her face. &ldquo;So what exactly is going on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had an experience sort of like yours. I ended up in a strange place. And I met someone. Someone dangerous. He stabbed me, right here.&rdquo; And her hand went to her exposed sternum, where Isaac could see a fine white line. He was all business now.</p><p>&ldquo;You went on a <span class=foreign-lang lang=cro title="dream quest">bilisshíissanne</span>, a dream quest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh I was wide awake. On ecstasy and just out of a club with my friend. Hardly a dream quest&mldr; Your crow is laughing at me again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I came to, my eyes had changed and I suddenly could see magic. And I have had several assassination attempts on me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anyway, I think your murderer, you said he disappeared for a time&mldr; I think he ended up in another place, another of what we call hidden kingdoms. One where he lost his sanity and came back changed. He may have come back with magic or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And these &lsquo;hidden kingdoms&rsquo;? What else should I know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is more, but I don&rsquo;t think I am ready to share. I think your bird knows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I bet it does, but it is an asshole.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella watched the bird squawk and flutter away, right through a wall and she traced it through until it went far above the cloud cover.</p><p>&ldquo;Your eyes glow through your contacts when you do that.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella smiled and Isaac suddenly went back to being awkward. They talked about nothing and had a great time.</p><p>As her Lyft pulled up, he said &ldquo;Ella, I had a great time. I&rsquo;d like to take you out again.&rdquo;</p><p>She smiled and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;d be nice.&rdquo;</p><p>She kissed him on the cheek and got into the car.</p><p>Ella arrived back to Charlie&rsquo;s, showered up and put on some comfy pajamas. Charlie and Jade were on the couch scanning through movie choices. Ella grabbed the loveseat next to them and a blanket and curled up. Tomorrow, she&rsquo;d get up early and head back to the scorpion compound, but she just wanted to chill.</p><p>Eventually they just started chatting and put on some old, stupid comedy.</p><p>Near the end though, Ella stood up and said, &ldquo;Thats it!&rdquo;</p><hr><h4 id=aqrabuamelu-compound-flushing-queens-new-york-united-states-1>Aqrabuamelu compound; Flushing, Queens, New York, United States</h4><p>Arcsa was still in his office, he often worked late in the evenings, especially since the death of Belatsunat. Consecrating a new High Priest or Priestess was a long, involved process. And the current candidates were quite varied. Many wanted him to take on the mantle, but Arcsa had enough on his plate.</p><p>He regarded the number on his screen. One more down today, killed in a pointless battle, like they all were. He pressed a button and decremented the counter.</p><p>And then Ella, their great hope, their only hope, burst in wearing a coat over pajamas and, were those bunny slippers?</p><p>Arcsa regarded Ella as she came in. He liked her, she was earnest, hard-working, and dedicated. But most importantly, she was compassionate. The Aqrabuamelu would not serve another Ekerri if it could be helped, and Arcsa would kill her before she could fulfill prophecy if needed. He was her Prophet, but he had duties to his people.</p><p>&ldquo;I have a plan for Donna!&rdquo;</p><p>He motioned her to sit down. &ldquo;Let me call in Bahu as well.&rdquo;</p><p>They waited, Arcsa calmly continuing to work through reports and Ella practically vibrating with excitement in her chair.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class='container sep-before'></div></footer></article><article lang=en class=entry><div class='container entry-content'><blockquote class=authorsnote><h2>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2><p>There are two things I struggle with in this chapter.</p><p>Writing romance. It is so awkward to write. I tried to get a good balance of lust and common interest. But I probably messed it up.</p><p>And then Charlie&rsquo;s interactions with Ella. Since I am male and writing women, it os hard to make sure I am not just transferring male gaze stuff to a female character in an attempt to launder it into some sort of respectability.</p><p>But at the same time, Charlie is aggressive about using sexuality as a weapon and is trying to arm the much more prudish Ella with it.</p><p>I fully admit I steal shamelessly from shows like Broad City and other female driven shows to try and get the balance right. But do women talk to other women about their periods? Or is that just a menstrual pad ad? I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>So it is a delicate, nervous dance.</p><p>At least I think every chapter would pass a Bechdel test with flying colors, but that should be the floor.</p></blockquote></div></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class='prev-entry sep-before'><a title="Previous page in vol01" href=/vol01/01.080-cowboy/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
