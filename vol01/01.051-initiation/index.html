His spear to strike his enemies. And we reveled in that service and feasted on our enemies defeat. None were more loyal.&rdquo; Arcsa began the liturgy.</p><p>&ldquo;None were more loyal.&rdquo; Said the other four in response. Arcsa had said she would learn the liturgy later and to stay quiet now. But she felt so conspicuous.</p><p>The High Priestess took the next verse. &ldquo;We served Utu as he ordered us into the realms of the dragons, whom we slaughtered without pity. We served Utu and he had us slay the mages of the green lands and salt the earth. We served Utu and crucified humans unending. We served Utu and slaughtered our own. None were more loyal.&rdquo;</p><p>Again the call and response. Nobody gave her a look at the mention of humans but she could feel their attention shift.</p><p>Arcsa took the next verse. &ldquo;We were called to war in the tunnels of the dwarves. Kothin, Utu&rsquo;s seneschal, ordered us into the volcanic mountain of his own people to wipe them out. And we did. None were more loyal.&rdquo;</p><p>The cant continued.</p><p>The High Priestess was next, &ldquo;And then came the betrayal!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The betrayal&rdquo; said the group, renewing their memory and refreshing their anger.</p><p>Arcsa, &ldquo;and prophecy.&rdquo;</p><p>Back to the High Priestess, &ldquo;we had just slain Denvin, the dwarven king, and suddenly the world shrunk. And we found ourselves in Kur suffering for thirty thousand years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, Arcsa, was there. And we starved and ate mushrooms and scavenged water. Many of our people died. We used our magic to replace those we could, but even that magic slowly ran dry.&rdquo; And he looked at the supplicants around him as if to reflect on their reduced numbers.</p><p>&ldquo;I, High Priestess, was there. And I was called Belatsunat. I carried the flame of hope. I remembered the prophecies of Utu. That we would fear Kur, the hell of flames, and we would one day be free and a true people. That Inanna would rescue us and lead us to the bright future.&rdquo;</p><p>The figure to her left stood up, a woman, &ldquo;I, Davcina, was not there. But I remember.&rdquo; She was tall and handsome with stern features. Her eyes were a storm at sea blue-grey, and she had high sharp cheekbones.</p><p>The one to the left of her stood up, &ldquo;I, Tauthe, was not there. But I remember.&rdquo; Tauthe contrasted with Davcina being shorter and rounder although in this audience of lean warriors, she was only plump in comparison. Her face was wide and open and looked friendly.</p><p>Next was a man, &ldquo;I, Adrahasis, was not there. But I remember.&rdquo; Adrahasis was as tall as Davcina or a bit taller. He might have been Davcina&rsquo;s sibling, so similar did they look.</p><p>Another man, &ldquo;I, Etana, was not there, but I remember.&rdquo; Etana, to Ella&rsquo;s right, had long braided hair which hid his face. His voice was raspy, like a chronic smoker.</p><p>Finally Bahu stood up, to Ella&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;I, Bahu, was there. And I will feast on Utu raw before my life ends.&rdquo; Bahu&rsquo;s voice was unlike anything Ella had heard before. Raw with pain.</p><p>They waited a moment and Arcsa smiled and gestured for her.</p><p>She stood up uncertainly, her legs numb from the unaccustomed kneeling position. She took a moment, aware of the silence. &ldquo;I, Eesha, was not there.&rdquo; And she paused. &ldquo;But I will learn.&rdquo; She did not know what to say.</p><p>It was enough. Without a word the group relaxed and filed out of the ceremonial room.</p><p>Arcsa and the High Priestess followed out at the end and the division was already clear by the small amount of space that was between her and the rest of the group.</p><p>He clapped his hands sharply which made Ella jump, &ldquo;Today is a day of firsts. The first time we have done our rituals in English. The first time we have had a human join us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The first time we have had so few.&rdquo; The High Priestess said.</p><p>Arcsa gave an annoyed glance at her. &ldquo;Yes. The first time so few.&rdquo;</p><p>Tauthe stepped forward and asked the obvious, &ldquo;Why is she here? Who is she?&rdquo;</p><p>It was as if the dam broke, now the others eyes were all on her, perhaps not outright hostile but unfriendly.</p><p>&ldquo;Eesha is a special case. Our numbers dwindle and we await Inanna&rsquo;s return. So we must make do&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how can she&mldr; how can she be one of us?&rdquo; Tauthe&rsquo;s voice was bewildered and angry at the same time.</p><p>Arcsa smiled his grandfatherly smile on them, &ldquo;She can be trusted. And Bahu will chaperone her and help her catch up.&rdquo;</p><p>Bahu gave a large toothy smile and wave.</p><p>The High Priestess stood forward. &ldquo;Our numbers are too few to allow for the Blooding. And you know what that means - you will all need to prove yourselves loyal and strong. In my Blooding I slew my sister and ate of her. You shall not have that proof. The elders will judge you for it despite it not being your fault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It does not matter what they think. All that matters is we find Inanna before our race dies. That we make a bloody ruin of Utu-the-Betrayer. That we fulfill prophecy.&rdquo;</p><p>Tauthe was not cowed, &ldquo;Will there be other humans?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; said Arcsa.</p><p>And the room adjourned.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class='container sep-before'></div></footer></article><article lang=en class=entry><div class='container entry-content'></div></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class='prev-entry sep-before'><a title="Previous page in vol01" href=/vol01/01.050-outtakes-bloopers/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
