### Atacama, Chile

"Bring the find here," Kothin yelled down the tunnel.  

"¿<i lang="es" title="What?">Que </i>?" came a voice across the field . 

Kothin cursed a bit and then pulled out his phone. After a bit of typing, "<i lang="es" title="Bring it here!">¡Tráelo aquí!</i>"

The workers worked their way over, sloshing right through the intervening brine pool.

"<i lang="es" title="Give it to me">Dámelo</i>" he said perfunctorily.  The workers handed over the  lithium slurry. Kothin could feel the mineral composition and after a lot of cursing, reference to the translation app, and hand gestures indicated the processing that still needed to take place. 

His phone rang and he waved the workers off.

"My lord....  no. I have no idea what the girl is doing. I am in Chile taking care of our mining operations. What? No. It is awful - I wish we could just go back to pickaxes."

He listened for a while longer answering with yeses and noes. 

Later that night, he was sipping a glass of local wine[^1] absentmindedly reviewing production figures.
