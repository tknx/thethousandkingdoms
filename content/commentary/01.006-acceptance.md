This was all Ella needing to feel real, and I did not expect it when I wrote it. She kind of skipped from denial to the end. Was it truly acceptance or was it her just going a bit more wild? I kind of thought of her as a third date kind of girl, but sometimes your own characters surprise you.

And then, of course, she got stabbed.
