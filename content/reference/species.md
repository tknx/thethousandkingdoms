*Ascended* - Ascended are individuals how met an unknown threshold and now exist on other planes of existance. When they manifest on middle planes, they will often exhibit sensory aberrations because of their partial presence and power leakage from the other plane. 

*Dwarves* - Dwarven males are 120 to 140cm (4' to 4'6) and females are average 5cm taller. They both appear to be roughly chiseled out of  stone and rock. Their matrilineal clans are organized by rough colorations althrough intermarriage is common.

*Elves* - Elves are classically beautiful in a human sense, but often fall within the "uncanny valley" of being slightly different. They will have 

*Fae* - Fae will typically follow idealized human norms in sizing and appearance, but with metallic skin (gold for summer, silver for winter) and wings. They are fluid in gender and identity, the same fae shifting between both male, female, non-sexual, and hermaphroditic forms; as well as taking on new names that do not often coincide with appearance changes. They will change affiliation between courts in internecine struggles and their skin will change suit. Their wings will ape a variety of normal species such as birds and butterflies and do not shift as the fae changes shape. It is unclear what meaning the wings may have. The fae are notorious for lying through omission, but their social norms are rigorously enforced by others.

*Lamia* - Lamia are female part dragon and part either human or elf who wildly vary in how much of their body presents as reptilian and how mach as human or elf based on early mosaicization and differentiation. So a lamia female may be almost entirely dragon or entirely human or elf; or some midpoint between. Males will always present as the contributor of their X chromosome as either dragon or human/elf. Both will typically exhibit some degree of behavior from both sides. 

*Minotaur* - A Minotaur would fit with the Greek ideal of being human bodied (215cm on average) with bull heads. They are less sexually dimorphic than humans, with female minotaurs being slightly more slender but usually the same height. 

*Orc* - Orcs range from 190cm to 200cm with less variation than humans. Their skin color will change from dusky grey-green to dark grey with age. Eyes typically resemble a cats ranging in color from yellow to green. Orcs will lack a nose or ears, instead having holes set in their head. Their teeth are carnivorous and like sharks, they will often lose teeth consistently and regrow them. An orc will typically be 20-30% stronger than an equivalently sized human.
