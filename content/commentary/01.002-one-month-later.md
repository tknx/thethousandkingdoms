Yes it is a bit of a skip ahead, but often I find that the pacing of stories feels unrealistic. Also a month of having crystalline white eyes and putting in contacts to cover them makes it feel more real that she is back to living her life for the most part.

And then you get ambushed by a party. A magical dance party in Harlem on your way up town. Charlie doesn't get past the red rope of magic. Charlie and Ella may be friends and fellow Physics Ph.D's but they are young and in New York and like to party. Charlie more than Ella. 

One thing you will note that there is no consistent length to the chapters. I write til I hit the point I am done. Maybe one day there will be a one word chapter ;)
