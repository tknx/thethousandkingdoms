Obviously you aren&rsquo;t to tell anyone about the Inanna thing. But you will train with them on weekends. Both you and they have other duties during the week and we will be using the evenings to get you caught up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do I need to catch up on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything. Weapons training mostly. We will spend time conditioning and other stuff but honestly you seem close to the mark there at least. Cultural things. You&rsquo;ll need to learn Sumerian.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What will they be doing during the week?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Learning to pretend to be human. They are all about your age, and have never been out of their crèche before now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Children are precious to us. Because upon coming of age, they are Blooded and many do not survive. So we keep them close.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella sat and thought. &ldquo;When I spoke to Arcsa, he said you could not breed. But it sounds like you use magic to do so.&rdquo;</p><p>Bahu looked a bit pensive, &ldquo;so he laid it all out for you? Yes. We used to have those coming of age battle it out to see who should go forward. But now our numbers are too few.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How many are left?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If Arcsa didn&rsquo;t tell you that, then I certainly won&rsquo;t. Come on, let&rsquo;s go meet your cohort.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella reached out to stop Bahu, &ldquo;Bahu. Who is Arcsa?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Arcsa is Your prophet.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>They entered a room with the other five, who were all midstream changing into casual clothes from the white muslin ceremonial robes they had been wearing.</p><p>Bahu piped in with a cheery, &ldquo;well you all have fun this weekend! Hard work coming up. See ya!&rdquo; And shut the door behind Ella.</p><p>Ella was starting to suspect Bahu of apostasy.</p><p>They four others stared at her and she looked back. Ella felt like a deer in headlights and was hoping her reckless side would come to the fore to save her as it had previously.</p><p>Nope. Crickets.</p><p>&ldquo;Hmm. Hi everyone. I&rsquo;m Eesha. But you can call me Ella if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p><p>Tauthe spoke up again. Her features at odds with her stern tone, &ldquo;Human. Why are you here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Umm. I am not, well&mldr; Arcsa said to be?&rdquo; And she shrugged and held up her hands wide in a pose of helplessness.</p><p>&ldquo;Well we don&rsquo;t want you here. Our people are dying while vermin like you consume everything like locusts. We have seen what you have done to the world and the best thing we can do is wipe you out.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella snapped back, &ldquo;I am pretty sure we would wipe you out. There can&rsquo;t be what? 5000 of you left?&rdquo;</p><p>Oscar Wilde had said that if the gods wished to punish us, they would answer our prayers. Perhaps hoping for recklessness to carry her was such a prayer.</p><p>Adrahasis snorted a laugh, &ldquo;Leave off Tauthe, we are stuck with her anyway. We aren&rsquo;t here to question Bahu or Arcsa.&rdquo;</p><p>He went on, &ldquo;So&mldr; Ella. Do you know why you are here? We rarely have humans come here, and they are just here as instructors and gone the next day</p><p>&ldquo;Ummm.. train? Bahu was supposed to help me out here, but, well&mldr;&rdquo; and Ella gestured at the closed door behind her.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on then. I&rsquo;m Adrahasis but call me Adra. You met Tauthe but let&rsquo;s do proper introductions.&rdquo;</p><p>Each took their turn. Etana was last and he was gorgeous. Long black hair he pulled out of his face. Burnished bronze skin. Grey eyes. Ella felt herself flush a bit.</p><p>And that set Davcina off. She started laughing and almost fell over. &ldquo;See Etty, even humans. You are just too good looking. Besides, she is almost as good looking as you. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo; Said Etana. His raspy voice was cold and harsh but he smiled a bit and winked at her which set Davcina off again.</p><p>Tauthe still looked at her suspiciously but relented.</p><p>&ldquo;To give you a better idea, we are here to train as a squad. Learn tactics and establish our capabilities to operate autonomously.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Operate as what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Military. Our people join your armies and occasionally function as mercenaries around the world. We must keep our skills current for the return of Inanna.&rdquo;</p><p>All of them murmured a phrase, something which Ella suspected was a prayer to Inanna. Which made her pretty uncomfortable.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you to become a believer?&rdquo; asked Tauthe. &ldquo;I have never heard of a human joining our faith. But Bahu is the most devout of us. So I doubt she would associate with a non-believer readily.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella was twisting in the wind when the door opened again and Bahu came in. &ldquo;Of course she will be a believer. And I believe one whose fervor will exceed my own!&rdquo;</p><p>Bahu handed out small boxes to each of them. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t go spending it all in one place. Normally we would send you with a senior for your first free night out, but with Ella here,&rdquo; and Bahu clamped both hands on Ella&rsquo;s shoulders, &ldquo;I am sure you will all be fine! Make sure you are back here by Monday at 5am for first call.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Except you Ella. You have your human life to maintain. You&rsquo;ll be here each weekend for unit training.&rdquo;</p><p>And Ella saw the issue. If she was gone all the time, she would always be apart. If this was a group she was supposed to bond with, how could she bridge this gap?</p><p>&ldquo;Ummm&mldr;&rdquo; Ella got started but was interrupted.</p><p>&ldquo;No time. Go out and have fun and debauchery. But remember.&rdquo; And at this, Bahu became dead serious.</p><p>&ldquo;No exposing us and no unsanctioned killing. If you do so&mldr; well we will all dine on your flesh.&rdquo;</p><p>Then a switch back in tone, &ldquo;Anyway have fun!&rdquo;</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class='container sep-before'></div></footer></article><article lang=en class=entry><div class='container entry-content'></div></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class='prev-entry sep-before'><a title="Previous page in vol01-ku" href=/vol01-ku/01.051-initiation/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
