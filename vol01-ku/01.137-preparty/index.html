How do you know where to get fancy sarees? I don&rsquo;t even know where to get fancy sarees!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, you uncultured brute. I am a sophisticate in a land of philistines!&rdquo;</p><p>They went to look at themselves in the mirror. Ella felt like an imposter when she looked at the image in front of her.</p><p>&ldquo;Remind me why I have to wear this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it Ella, this was your idea. Everett Marr is a fucking neo-Nazi. He won&rsquo;t care if you are a visitor from another country, but if you are here to stay? The rest of them are all too rich to not put up with the occasional non-white person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mldr; you know I can&rsquo;t do an Indian accent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A source of great disappointment for me always.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No fuck it. I went to school here. I am not going to be able to pull it off otherwise&rdquo;</p><p>The saree was beautiful. Her mom would probably love to see it on her. The <span class=foreign-lang lang=hi title=skirt>lehenga</span> was ivory in color with a subtle embroidery at the top that made its way down to more intricate, dense patterns as it swept down. The blouse had the same intricate embroidery. The tassles hanging down from the top tickled her bare stomach.</p><p>She shifted the drape. and Charlie frowned in disapproval, &ldquo;You can face down my dad, kill magical assassins and mercenaries, but you wimp out showing some abs? F that.&rdquo;</p><p>She reached over to adjust the drape into some sort of intricate pattern.</p><p>&ldquo;Where did you get this again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From my closet.&rdquo;</p><p>Eventually Charlie couldn&rsquo;t take Ella&rsquo;s constant questioning and told her to follow her. Ella walked into Charlie&rsquo;s bedroom.</p><p>The bedroom would have been obscene anywhere, but especially in New York, with high peaked ceilings and skylights. The chevron wood floor and wainscoting would have made Ella think Paris. It was also remarkably&mldr; dare she think it of Charlie&mldr; feminine. The walls were powder blue, the four poster bed had gauzy drapes on it, the crystal chandelier hanging from the vaulted ceiling was tasteful.</p><p>They walked right past the bed, a hidden door opened into a hallway which led to a closet.</p><p>It was filled with clothes. And not normal clothes. There was a huge safe and a wall of gowns and cocktail dresses. Ella supposed those were the kind of thing you wore to Southern dances and fancy evening events. Along the shorter wall were a variety of international formal dresses. There was a Japanese <em>kimono,</em> a Korean <em>hanbok,</em> several other types of dresses she did not recognize including a very fancy Victorian looking getup.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that one?&rdquo; Ella asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an <em>Ohorokova</em> from Namibia.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have an Oho&mldr; Oho&mldr; that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mother insists when we are entertaining, we wear appropriate dress for whoever is visiting. This is just the stuff she made me bring to New York. My closet in Savannah is like twice this size.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are your regular clothes?&rdquo;</p><p>They went back to the hall and down a bit further to another closet of the same ridiculous size. But it was mostly empty. Five club dresses which Ella recognized hung on one end, with a couple of heels carelessly tossed beneath them. There were a couple pairs of jeans lying on the floor and some casual shirts thrown about as well. Ella saw the shirt she had gotten for Charlie carefully hung up, the only one that was straightly hung instead of being twisted. And then there were a bunch of work outfits including the one that Ella had borrowed so long ago. A few sundresses and other stuff lay strewn about.</p><p>&ldquo;You slob.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shove it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You also have way too much space.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. I was thinking about moving the gym over here and taking that room. The room echoes too much and I hate it&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Charlie took her back to the fancy dress room and opened the large safe in the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Here is all the Indian jewelry I got&mldr; ah, here is the nose chain - I never did get my nose pierced. I should have, my mom would have freaked!&rdquo;</p><p>Ella began to put on the various pieces of jewelry, the anklets, bangles, rings. There was more than enough for five people, so she loaded up.</p><p>She hadn&rsquo;t taken out her studs in months, and she worked them out and then stuck in some earrings. Then took them out and tried other ones.</p><p>She took the nose chain and she threaded the earring part on. Then she did something remarkably stupid and impulsive and jabbed the nose ring right through her nose.</p><p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo;</p><p>Charlie whirled around to see Ella holding her nose. But there was a flash of light, and she removed her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe I should become a body piercer, magic is really, really good for it.&rdquo; Ella said.</p><p>&ldquo;Ella, I think you are nuts. But it does look pretty good.&rdquo;</p><p>The delicate set of chains going from her nose to her ear did look good. Ella looked a lot more, well, Indian than she normally did. From her nose, three delicate gold chains drew back to her ear following her cheekbones perfectly.</p><p>&ldquo;Perfect. Now I&rsquo;ll take all this stuff off and get packed. What are you wearing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a vintage Oscar de La Renta that I scored in the East Village&mldr; Let me go find it.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>Ella grabbed both overnight bags and carried them to the elevator and down, Charlie&rsquo;s bag was pretty hefty.</p><p>&ldquo;What is in here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Couple of bottles of vodka to spike the punch with. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sure they have a liquor there. It is a winery.&rdquo;</p><p>Outside there were non-descript dark grey SUVs in a row, riding a bit low which Ella had come to recognize as the extra weight of the armor plating.</p><p>Holding the door open was Zaidu in full tactical gear. Ella took a look around and saw that not only was there a squad on each end of the block, but several of the &ldquo;pedestrians&rdquo; had that telltale glow of Aqrabuamelu scorpion legs.</p><p>&ldquo;What is going on here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Arcsa is inside,&rdquo; Zaidu spat.</p><p>He took their bags and threw them in back and came back with vests.</p><p>&ldquo;Zaidu, neither of us can wear vests in there. Are you kidding, this is a political fundraiser, not a war.&rdquo;</p><p>He threw them at Ella who caught them and just gave up and crawled into the Escalade. Charlie followed. Ella threw the vests behind her into the trunk.</p><p>Inside Arcsa and the High Priestess sat in the middle row, facing them. Arcsa&rsquo;s distinguished long silver hair was in disarray. The High Priestess was in her Major&rsquo;s outfit.</p><p>No wait. Ella eyed the markings on the High Priestess&rsquo;s uniform, &ldquo;Congratulations on the promotion Lieutenant Colonel Khouri.&rdquo;</p><p>The High Priestess smiled and winked, &ldquo;I was once a <span class=foreign-lang lang=gr title=general>strategoi</span> for the Eastern Roman Empire, so this is still kind of a demotion.&rdquo;</p><p>Arcsa interrupted, &ldquo;This is a terrible idea. Marr tried to have you and your family killed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You told me that on Monday. And Tuesday. And twice on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you have to go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Damn it Arcsa, I am the only one of us who can see magic. I have to go. Charlie&rsquo;s father managed to secure us invites and we are going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me send Ansheth. He can see magic&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was unstable before I freed him of his programming, he is positively unhinged now.&rdquo;</p><p>Arcsa uncharacteristically grumbled under his breath. He started digging into the large duffel bag he had at his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Fine. Take this.&rdquo; he handed Ella an earring and a bracelet.</p><p>The High Priestess began to explain, &ldquo;The earring is a disguised comm. The bracelet has a panic call button - you press it and we breach.</p><p>She went on, &ldquo;We have been placing assets in the area over the past week. I have an AWACS tasked, two Apaches conducting &rsquo;training also&rsquo;, additional have coptersed disguised as civilians, and two fast scramblers fueled and ready. There are four platoons located around the winery as well on standby.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella looked at the High Priestess, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t serious?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dead serious. We have infiltrated the waitstaff and also two squads have sealed themselves into a cellar five days ago. If you press the button, the room will be flooded with fentanyl, and the soldiers will immediately breach.&rdquo;</p><p>Arcsa pulled another thing out of the bag and handed over what looked like an asthma inhaler. &ldquo;This has a very short supply of oxygen. Enough for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you at least get me some black contacts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Ella tore open the packs and put the contacts in. She had gotten used to not bothering anymore but this was not the place to be conspicuous.</p><p>Arcsa handed each of Ella and Charlie a knife, &ldquo;Polymer blades, won&rsquo;t set off any metal detectors.&rdquo; Then odd, slim pistols in thigh holsters, of a kind that Ella had never seen before. &ldquo;Also polymer. Bullets don&rsquo;t have good range, but inside you should be okay.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at Charlie, &ldquo;I heard your shooting is terrible. Don&rsquo;t hit Eleanor.&rdquo;</p><p>Charlie was wide eyed. This was perhaps the first time she had seen the Aqrabuamelu get serious. She reached out and took the pistol.</p><p>&ldquo;Zaidu will come in officially as your bodyguard. We also have other leverage lined up.&rdquo;</p><p>The two lead SUVs pulled out followed by them and then the two trailing ones. They drove across the Brooklyn Bridge and onto the <abbr title="Brooklyn Queens Expressway">BQE</abbr>. Once underway, Ella peered out the window and spotted two helicopters following them.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is my father?&rdquo; Charlie asked</p><p>&ldquo;He is heading to the Wall Street heliport and will be flying. The risk was deemed too high for you to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t going to have anti-aircraft weapons!&rdquo; Ella said, exasperated.</p><p>The High Priestess asked, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they? They attacked an innocent family, your family. Fanatics will do anything. Would they poison everyone including themselves to take you out? I don&rsquo;t know, but I have to worry about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella gave up. The irony of the Aqrabuamelu calling others fanatics was not lost on her. It was still ridiclous, the sheer amount of resources being put into them attending a fundraiser at a winery, and she knew there was nothing she could do about it.</p><p>The ride through Long Island wasn&rsquo;t restful at all. The radio chatter kept them from zoning out. Ella stared out the thick, distorted window and listened to it absentmindedly.</p><blockquote><p>Command. This is Vulture. Car approaching from west. 6 klicks. Speed 200 klicks. Time to intercept four minutes. Blue Porsche. Montana license plate six, five, zero, two, three, seven, bravo.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Vulture. Command. Copy that. Owner is on the guest list.</p></blockquote><p>The bright blue and orange Porsche approached them from behind. Zaidu, who was sitting in the front seat had his rifle in hand and looked ready to shoot the car at the drop of a pin. It passed them by, never slowing, weaving between traffic.</p><p>A few more cars were radioed in. All expensive. All with Montana plates.</p><p>&ldquo;Why Montana?&rdquo; asked Ella.</p><p>Charlie knew the answer, &ldquo;Low vehicle taxes for exotic cars.&rdquo;</p><p>They had gone about half an hour when the radio chatter picked up.</p><blockquote><p>Command. This is Eagle. There is a block on the road ahead. Twenty klicks until stop. Looks like an accident.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Command. This is Vulture. I have two fast movers. Large Suburbans. Tinted windows. Plates are obscured. ETA five minutes.</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; the High Priestess said. She spoke into the radio, &ldquo;Eagle, this is Prime. Are alternate routes secure?&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>Prime. Eagle. Negative. Significant traffic on both.</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Caboose One-Two, drop back for a visual. Point One, accelerate to investigate the accident.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>Copy.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Copy.</p></blockquote><p>The two SUVs behind them began to slow down. The first lead SUV put on police lights and sped up.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just an accident.&rdquo; Charlie said. She looked wide eyed.</p><p>But Ella knew what was up, &ldquo;This stretch has only two exits and they are backed up. It could be a setup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pull off the road now. Let&rsquo;s set up on the side,&rdquo; Arcsa said.</p><p>Zaidu who had been sitting in the front yelled, &ldquo;Arcsa hold. We don&rsquo;t know if it is clear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ella&mldr; what does he mean?&rdquo; Charlie whispered.</p><p>&ldquo;He is worried the land on either side is trapped.&rdquo; Ella answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Are we going to be attacked?&rdquo; Charlie was scared. Her hand reached out and Ella held her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Charlie, I&rsquo;d say odds are less than ten percent. This is just&mldr; precautionary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This? This is fucking making me paranoid as shit.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella turned around and grabbed the two vests she had thrown in the back. She grabbed the rifles that were back there and starting handing them and magazines around. Zaidu had his already. But Arcsa and the High Priestess took one each and started checking them.</p><p>She gave a vest to Charlie, &ldquo;Put this on. Let&rsquo;s just be careful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eleanor, you are not going out there if it comes to a fight.&rdquo; Arcsa said.</p><p>&ldquo;Arcsa, as long as you are slaves, I am not leaving you to die for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then free us! Now!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You saw what happened to Ansheth, he is a gibbering mess. What if that happens to you?&rdquo;</p><p>Arcsa looked her in the eye. &ldquo;You said you were close. Do me now. If it will get you to retreat, then do it now!&rdquo;</p><p>Ella shook her head, &ldquo;Honestly, even if you guys were free. I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to leave people to die for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella checked her chamber and loaded a mag. The HK556 felt so much lighter than those stupid next gen rifles. And having an extra ten rounds felt worth it.</p><p>The High Priestess was back on the comms, &ldquo;Vulture. This is Prime acting as <abbr title="Joint Terminal Attack Controller">JTAC</abbr>. Type 1 in effect. Advise ready for nine lines.&rdquo;</p><p>They were slowly approaching the traffic back-up</p><blockquote><p>Arcsa. This is Vulture. Ready to copy.</p></blockquote><p>Charlie tugged on Ella&rsquo;s hand, her pale was sweaty. Ella had turned around and was using her rifle scope to look back through the rear window. Arcsa was doing the same.</p><p>&ldquo;Ella, what are they doing? What are nine lines? What the hell is going on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Arcsa, switch with us.&rdquo; Ella said.</p><p>They quickly shuffled, Arcsa and the Hogh Priestess moved to the back seat with Ella and Charlie now in the middle seat which faced towards the back.</p><p>&ldquo;Charlie, look at me. Look at me.&rdquo; Ella grabbed Charlie&rsquo;s hands which were trembling.</p><p>Charlie looked up at Ella.</p><p>&ldquo;Nine lines are a way to control an air attack. I don&rsquo;t know all the details, but Type 1 means that Arcsa wants to see the cars before any attack. Then each of the next nine parts described the enemy and how to approach and attack. Vulture is some sort of air support.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s two Apaches loaded,&rdquo; hissed Zaidu. He glared at her from the front seat like she should have known that and then went back to his binoculars, scannning each side of the road.</p><p>&ldquo;The escort behind us slowed down to get a look at the cars. Our lead car sped up to the accident. They&rsquo;ll report soon, just hold on. This is just being careful - most likely it is all a coincidence&rdquo;</p><p>Ella heard Charlie whispering her little mantra when she was upset, over and over again. &ldquo;I never did mind about the little things&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Charlie&rsquo;s hand was clammy and she looked pale. Ella pulled her in for a hug which was pretty uncomfortable when wearing a plate carrier.</p><blockquote><p>Prime. This is Point One. We confirmed the accident is legit. Couple of people arguing on the side of the road. Traffic clearing. We are rendering assistance as police.</p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;Copy,&rdquo; the High Priestess said.</p><blockquote><p>Command. This is Caboose 1 and 2. We are slowing the suspects. Advise ready for license plate.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Caboose. This is Command. Ready for plates</p></blockquote><p>The New Jersey plates were read out over the radio and they all waited.</p><blockquote><p>Arcsa. This is Command. Both plates are registered to Thierry Hinault, French born industrialist. Known guest of party.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Arcsa. This is Caboose. Visual established. Threat assessment is minimal. I repeat. Threat assessment is minimal.</p></blockquote><p>The atmosphere instantly changed. Ella let out a breath she hadn&rsquo;t realized she was holding. Arcsa put up his rifle and called in</p><p>&ldquo;Copy all. Maintain alert posture.&rdquo;</p><p>The others provided their affirmations but the atmosphere was relaxed.</p><p>The High Priestess put up her rifle. Then looked up at Charlie, her eyes compassionate. &ldquo;Charlie? This is mostly routine. We just like to be careful here.&rdquo;</p><p>They watched as their own two trailing SUVs caught up, trailed by the two suspect SUVs stuck behind them. The traffic ahead was slowly opening up.</p><p>Ella gave her another hug.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry Charlie. I know you aren&rsquo;t used to this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you are?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I spent weeks being hunted by an assassin back at the compound. That was way worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you are going to live like this?&rdquo; Charlie looked at her, spooked like she was now seeing the ramifications.</p><p>&ldquo;I will do whatever it takes.&rdquo; Ella said grimly. &ldquo;To make this work.&rdquo;</p><p>Charlie had nothing to say about that. Well except, &ldquo;Is it weird I do not want a drink?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; Ella reassured her.</p><hr><p>When they arrived near the location of the party, they pulled off the road.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Ella asked.</p><p>&ldquo;The <em>dragon</em> secured us a base of operations in Sag Harbor. Our advance team has confirmed it is ready.&rdquo; Arcsa had still not made his peace with Xu. The wars between the Aqrabuamelu and dragons had left their scars.</p><p>When they pulled in, Ella knew they had gone too far.</p><p>&ldquo;This? This is the advance team? You said there were four platoons near the winery.&rdquo;</p><p>There were at least a hundred soldiers crawling all over the rustic house.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, there are. And there are more here, Eleanor.&rdquo; Arcsa stopped and looked her in the eyes, &ldquo;Marr is one of the wealthiest people in this country. Which means he has power. Add in his own private military contractors, he has a decent sized military force. This is enough. But just barely. If it was up to me, we would just drop napalm on the winery and shoot anyone that tries to escape.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When we started, you said leverage. What does that mean?&rdquo; Charlie piped up. Ella had forgotten about that comment.</p><p>A voice from behind answered.
