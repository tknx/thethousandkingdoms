Notice a common theme with Ella’s training? If you say getting knocked on her ass, you would be right. 

Obviously training the way she does only takes you so far for real fighting. Add knives, bites, and friends to an MMA match and it will go south fast. I am not a knife fighter by any means and my understanding is the loser is basically who bleeds out first. May have to do more research there. 

[The Joffrey Ballet Company](https://joffrey.org/the-company/) was definitely a stretch for Ella but not a huge one just to contextualize her skills there. 

The music footnotes are just for fun. They aren’t all my thing but I like to give each character a bit of a soundtrack. Is it hugely insightful? No.  Just a fun extra. 

Plus forces me to get out of my own comfort zone on music.  So that is a personal gain.

But the montage must come to an end and we have to get back to the magical.
