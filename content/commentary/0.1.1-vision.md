Well here we go... I wanted to include some chapter by chapter commentary as I write these, but didn't want facetious or unnecessary author's notes, nor did I want them to be attached to the chapters directly. Think of this as the purely optional director's comment track.

And, to be fair, I will spoil the chapters as I see fit, so read those first.

When I started this story, I had a couple goals in mind.

1. I wanted to have fun writing something
2. To have flexibility in how the story progressed and the fantastical elements - to be able to switch genre freely
3. A compelling character that struggles a bit with her identity, but is smart and capable; and also someone my children could see themselves as
4. Other characters who behave in rational, adult ways, that have deep internal lives and motivations even if we don't know what they are.
5. And although I despise litrpg conventions, I wanted to track character development and abilities in a formal way
6. Finally I wanted to write a story for adults with adult themes and concerns.

Eventually I came up with the central conceit and started it off.

Anyway, onto the chapter.

Here we start introducing Ella and her best friend Charlie. They are grabbing a subway home from a club when Charlie, high as a kite, heads off down the subway tunnel (which is remarkably stupid by the way) and they end up finding a castle in New Jersey (not really).

Ella ends up getting stabbed in the chest and wakes up to find her eyes have changed to match the strange figure in her "dream." She does the very rational thing of going to an ophthalmologist to see what is going on - but the testing results reveal nothing. In the end, she ends up getting colored contacts to hide them. Our unnamed doctor will undoubtedly publish a case study on her called "Idiopathic pseudo-crystalline iritis" or something equally opaque.

When you have weird things going on in your life, a bit of denial can carry you through and Ella is definitely going that route for now.
