Since I know about fighting than physics expect me to spend more time on those scenes rather than her studying.</description></item><item><title>01.012 Halloween</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.012-halloween/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:58:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.012-halloween/</guid><description>A bit more training montage, but I wanted to bring back in some magic and even a sense of wonder. I feel like I missed the mark a bit. But that is okay.
I am not a hard magic guy for the most part despite some of my rpg type posts - my eyes glaze over at most hard magic systems, so I prefer it to be a bit ineffable.
That will get harder as we get to learning more about magic, I want to have the system underneath to keep it somewhat real, but to the reader it needs to feel like, well, magic.</description></item><item><title>01.011 Breathe</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.011-breathe/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 11:01:13 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.011-breathe/</guid><description>I was going for that calm before the storm vibe here, she is mentally getting her head into the game a bit. Taking stock. Taking time with her family.
I&amp;rsquo;ll probably come back and build this out when I do a big second pass to build on that feel more. But sometimes a chapter is just short.</description></item><item><title>01.010 Prep</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.010-prep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 21:00:41 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.010-prep/</guid><description>Dealing with one&amp;rsquo;s parents is often something that is brushed over in fantasy. You can&amp;rsquo;t have adventures with watchful parents. I somewhat get around this by having my protagonist be older, in grad school. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean she is estranged from her family, just exasperated sometimes.
Her father being an actor once and now a professor and her mother being a physician is intentional. She comes from an educated background but not one that is solely that way.</description></item><item><title>01.009 Exposition</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.009-exposition/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 13:34:19 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.009-exposition/</guid><description>Who knew that dwarves were trolls? Sorry I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help myself.
Obviously I wanted to subvert the trope a bit that dwarves were either fools like in LOTR or stoic. At the same time, I also added my own spin on them, making them rock-like creatures that are a bit more alien in nature than humans.
There is always a bit of give and take with that since you have to balance their alieness with their ability to interact in a meaningful way with humans.</description></item><item><title>01.008 Interlude Kennington</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.008-interlude-kennington/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 09:53:13 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.008-interlude-kennington/</guid><description>This chapter I am always going to say was super hard.
First, I was trying to write a character I can&amp;rsquo;t even say I pretend to understand, a council estates kid in Kennington, London from Brixton. So I am going to completely fuck up the vernacular and regional differences. He is teamed up with a native East Londoner from Kennington and a Brazilian Portuguese girl and they run into a couple Haitian pretwo lwa.
Second, I wanted it to be very in media res, but given how fast things go south, I had to move a bunch of stuff up front.</description></item><item><title>01.007 Again</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.007-again/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 18:53:01 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.007-again/</guid><description>This chapter was more difficult to write than the others - lots of establishing new characters and trying to imply familial relationships but with a hopefully light touch. Maybe I crammed too many conversations in here and didn&amp;rsquo;t let each one breathe, but it is a trade-off between endless dialog and moving things along, and in this story, it was just a bit of a breather.
Next chapter will be radically different.
Also, Ella switching between her American name and Indian name is very intentional.</description></item><item><title>01.006 Acceptance</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.006-acceptance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 19:03:42 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.006-acceptance/</guid><description>This was all Ella needing to feel real, and I did not expect it when I wrote it. A lot of the time characters pull you along with their own actions, and you just let them.
She kind of skipped from denial to the end. Was it truly acceptance or was it her just going a bit more wild? I kind of thought of her as a third date kind of girl, but sometimes your own characters surprise you.</description></item><item><title>01.020 History</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.020-history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.020-history/</guid><description>Ella hears a story of ice elves</description></item><item><title>01.021 Reset</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.021-reset/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.021-reset/</guid><description>Ella over does it and needs an intervention</description></item><item><title>01.018 Farflung Interests</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.018-farflung-interests/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.018-farflung-interests/</guid><description>Kothin is working at a lithium mine in Chile</description></item><item><title>01.019 Anxiety</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.019-anxiety/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.019-anxiety/</guid><description>Ella goes shooting</description></item><item><title>01.005 The Date</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.005-the-date/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:20:40 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.005-the-date/</guid><description>After the disappointment Ella experienced in her last chapter, I felt like I needed to kickstart the story with more evidence and someone else who maybe knows a little bit more than her. Most YA stories start with the parents dying so nobody can protect or explain what is going on - and the slow reveal is important to build this. But you can be slow, and you can be glacial.
So Jae-Young shows up. A guy who asked her out early on but they only got around to a date now.</description></item><item><title>01.005 The Date</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.005-the-date/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:20:40 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.005-the-date/</guid><description>Ella goes out on a date</description></item><item><title>01.004 You Can't Go Back</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.004-you-cant-go-back/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:11:54 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.004-you-cant-go-back/</guid><description>Ella is very good at denial but the cracks are showing.

Also a month of having crystalline white eyes and putting in contacts to cover them makes it feel more real that she is back to living her life for the most part.
And then you get ambushed by a party. A magical dance party in Harlem on your way up town. Charlie doesn&amp;rsquo;t get past the red rope of magic.</description></item><item><title>01.001 Vision</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.001-vision/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:05:48 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/commentary/vol01/01.001-vision/</guid><description>A quick intro Well here we go&amp;hellip; I wanted to include some chapter by chapter commentary as I write these, but didn&amp;rsquo;t want unnecessary author&amp;rsquo;s notes, nor did I want them to be attached to the chapters directly. Think of this as the purely optional director&amp;rsquo;s track.
And, to be fair, I will spoil the chapters as I see fit, so read those first.
When I started this story, I had a couple goals in mind.</description></item><item><title>The People</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/reference/species/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:05:48 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/reference/species/</guid><description>A guide to the various species of The Thousand Kingdoms</description></item><item><title>01.016 Blooded</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.016-blooded/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.016-blooded/</guid><description>Ella has a haunted Thanksgiving</description></item><item><title>01.017 Aqrabuamelu</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.017-aqrabuamelu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.017-aqrabuamelu/</guid><description>Arcsa discovers a way out of Kur</description></item><item><title>01.015 Investigation</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.015-investigation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.015-investigation/</guid><description>Ella takes the tooth to the applied physic&amp;rsquo;s lab</description></item><item><title>01.014 Punked</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.014-punked/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.014-punked/</guid><description>Ella spars with Donna</description></item><item><title>01.013 Sparring</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.013-sparring/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.013-sparring/</guid><description>Ella spars with Craig, meets with her advisor</description></item><item><title>01.012 Halloween</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.012-halloween/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.012-halloween/</guid><description>Ella spars with Craig and then goes out for Halloween</description></item><item><title>01.011 Breathe</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.011-breathe/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.011-breathe/</guid><description>Ella goes home from the hospital and plans</description></item><item><title>01.010 Prep</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.010-prep/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.010-prep/</guid><description>Ella goes home from the hospital and plans</description></item><item><title>01.009 Exposition</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.009-exposition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.009-exposition/</guid><description>Kothin tells Ella a little</description></item><item><title>01.007 Again</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.007-again/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.007-again/</guid><description>Ella wakes up in the hospital</description></item><item><title>01.008 Interlude -
