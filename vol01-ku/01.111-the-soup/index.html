The burn tub was filled to the brim with stem cells, growth factors, collagen matrices, and other assorted proteins and nutrients.</p><p>And it glowed in pulsing waves. No longer subtle, it sometimes pulsed bright enough Charlie had to cover her eyes. Ella was laying nude in the pool, and her skin was healing. The doctors still muttered about strange effects, unwilling to believe what was happening.</p><p>Charlie could even hold Ella&rsquo;s hand now which she often did. Isaac said that his bird saw magic pulsing in and out of her in huge waves, and the raven often had to leave the room because of the strange turbulence.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;The feint is over,&rdquo; Arcsa said, regarding the images on his screen. &ldquo;Recall our troops from around Weil Cornell and let&rsquo;s prepare for potential assault. Do we have our primary and secondary evac routes for Eleanor ready?&rdquo;</p><p>Bahu and Zana stood there at attention.</p><p>&ldquo;The retreat is planned with numerous decoys. But, according to this spirit bird of Isaac, the amount of magic going in and out of Ella makes her a beacon. If they have someone of sufficient sensitivity, they will know where she is.&rdquo;</p><p>Zana interrupted, &ldquo;Prophet, we should use that to our advantage. Set up an series of ambushes for any pursuers here, here, and here.&rdquo; She pointed at a couple of bends along the primary escape route to set traps.</p><p>&ldquo;Already done.&rdquo; Arcsa said. He had been at this for a very long time.</p><p>They watched the screen. A squad of seven soldiers was in the trees northeast of the medical facility, and they were steadily making their way towards where Arcsa sat right now.</p><p>&ldquo;Are our men in position?&rdquo; Arcsa asked over his comm. He heard a digital static chirp and then an affirmative. &ldquo;Satellite will be overhead for thirty more minutes. You have command, take them when ready.&rdquo;</p><p>They watched the images, figures moving through the woods. Aqrabuamuelu soldiers converging on the enemies and as they downed each of the hostiles quickly and efficiently. It was death at a distance, which was the same as death anywhere else.</p><p>&ldquo;They will bring the two officers to the basement for interrogation. Dispose of them after.&rdquo; Arcsa instructed Bahu.</p><p>&ldquo;What fun! For Blessed Inanna,&rdquo; Bahu said and turned on her heel and headed to the medical chambers that had been set up way from prying eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;They found us too quick.&rdquo; Arcsa mused, &ldquo;I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, at the rate we are throwing money into the fires of Kur, they would be bound to track us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes sir. There was no time to be subtle,&rdquo; Zana took a moment before she went on, &ldquo;The girl&mldr; she truly is Blessed Inanna. I saw her healing herself even though she doesn&rsquo;t wake.&rdquo;</p><p>Arcsa looked at her, &ldquo;Is there a question in that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&mldr; no.&rdquo; Zane turned and left the room to do whatever she did. Arcsa smiled gently at her retreating back. Eleanor&rsquo;s friend, Jade, walked in the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Um, sir,&rdquo; Jade said nervously, &ldquo;Bahu said I should talk with you about this.&rdquo; Jade put a glowing syringe on his desk.</p><hr><h3 id=puerto-iguazu-argentina>Puerto Iguazu, Argentina</h3><p>Seb looked with satisfaction at his boots. They were mirrors. When he had left with these strange soldiers, expecting to be a soldier in the army. He was a soldier now, but not in any army.</p><p>Namtar, the soldier who was teaching him, was a scary guy. He was now a mercenary for the Sinaloa Cartel in a meteoric rise that had involved a lot of bloodshed in a very short time.</p><p>He was also a better father than Seb had believed possible. Seb was eating well, learning things, and was on his way up in the world. He had almost forgotten about the drow and magic he had seen except when he woke up at night scared of the strange creature who had killed his father or homesick for his <em>barrio</em> of Villa 31. And Namtar would be there to hold him. And even better yet for Seb&rsquo;s sensibilities, kept his crying private and never ever made the slightest mention of it otherwise.</p><p>He got up in the morning and ran around in his shiny boots with the much older soldiers Namtar had brought with him. He got to learn soldier things like fighting. Listen in when they planned raids on their rivals. He even got to be a decoy once which was a lot of fun. The other soldiers all thought he would tire of it, but this was so much easier than being home, it was like a vacation.</p><p>So when Namtar said he was being sent north to the US, Seb wasn&rsquo;t happy at all. But Ella was up there, and every boy has his first crush to work through. Even street rats from Buenos Aires.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class='container sep-before'></div></footer></article><article lang=en class=entry><div class='container entry-content'></div></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class='prev-entry sep-before'><a title="Previous page in vol01-ku" href=/vol01-ku/01.110-exfiltrate/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
