They are cruel, vicious creatures that Ekerri bred for thousands of years to be hunting animals which he used in battle and war. They only respond to Ekerri.</dd><dt>Ascended</dt><dd>Ascended are a category for beings beyond the terrestrial plane. They may be individuals who met an unknown threshold and now exist on higher planes of existence. Or native species from those planes. When they manifest on the terrestrial plane, the inhabitants will perceive bizarre sensory aberrations because of the Ascended&rsquo;s partial manifestation and power resonance from the higher plane.<ul><li><strong>Fae</strong> - Fae will typically follow idealized human norms in sizing and appearance, but with metallic skin (gold for summer, silver for winter) and wings. They are fluid in gender and identity, the same fae shifting between both male, female, non-sexual, and hermaphroditic forms; as well as taking on new names that do not often coincide with appearance changes. They will change affiliation between courts in internecine struggles and their skin will change suit. Their wings will ape a variety of normal species such as birds and butterflies and do not shift as the fae changes shape. It is unclear what meaning the wings may have. The fae are notorious for lying through omission, but their social norms are rigorously enforced by other fae.</li></ul></dd><dt>Aqrabuamelu</dt><dd>Ekerri wished to conquer the Ascended realms. He was concerned that during this was in the Heavensm, competition could arise on the terrestrial plane, so he created the Aqrabuamelu to maintain his power. After the disappointment of the drow, he programmed with a more sophisticated religion, he was Utu-on-Earth, the avatar of their deity. In addition, he added a promise of hell (Kur) and refdemption by a mythical goddess (Innana) after in order to keep their morale high as he used them. Their goddess, when returned, would free them from the need to use magic to reproduce amongs themselves. When they breed with humans, they would produce other humans. The Aqrabuamelu know, in fact, that this is programming but are unable to deviate from it. Thus they preserve their intellectual capacity but are still controlled.
During the interregnum, they lost their ability to shapeshift and also lost the ability to steal strength from enemies by eating them. Culturally they have a High Priestess who is the leader of the people and practice ritual cannibalism among other rights. Their ceremonies are not formally ritualized and thus vary significantly for different time periods.
They typically look Middle Eastern with a slight reddish cast to their skin, and can innately transform between human and half-human/half-scorpion shapes.</dd><dt>Dragons</dt><dd>Ancient and powerful, these shape-shifting creatures are innately magical and thus survived the sequestering of magic by Ekerri. They were some of Ekerri&rsquo;s most powerful foes. They are natives if the ascendant planes and are now inhabitants on both terrestrial and ascended planes.</dd><dt>Drow</dt><dd>During Ekerri&rsquo;s early rule, he crossed Elves with a variety of different creatures and the drow were the result. They are strongly attuned to magic and are able to confuse the senses of those around them. They were programmed with a simple, dogmatic religion where Ekerri was their God, but this led to them being inflexible and thus they made poor spies. They are organized into matriarchal clans.</dd><dt>Dwarves</dt><dd>Dwarf are 120 to 140cm (4&rsquo; to 4'6) and appear to be roughly chiseled out of stone and rock. Their clans are organized by rough colorations although intermarriage is common. They are agendered and reproduce through some form of recombinative technique that reconstitutes the parents into multiple offspring. They do mate for life and will not take another mate.</dd><dt>Elves</dt><dd>Elves often fall within the &ldquo;uncanny valley&rdquo; of being different. Take a human and stretch them vertically. Their cheekbones are very sharp and they have elongated chins giving them triangular faces. Their eyes are canted an uncomfortable looking 30-35 degrees.<ul><li><strong>Huldufólk</strong> - Residing in a Hidden Kingdom that is anchored to our world near Húsavík, Iceland. They are mostly lost to their heritage but have access to disguising magic items to explore the wider world</li></ul></dd><dt>Keres</dt><dd>Near invisible spirits of the air, they live in beautifully tended gardens and are entirely pacifistic when at home. THey live for roughly three hundred years and they breed prolifically. To keep their numbers sustainable, the young are trained to kill for fifty years and sent out to hunt trophies which are judged when they return to determine if they are allowed to return. They answer to their Queen, Nyx, but have brokered a deal with Ekerri where they will perform assassinations for him for unknown payments.</dd><dt>Manticore</dt><dd>Human head, lion body, and scorpion tail. Ekerri created three of them soon after the Aqrabuamelu. They were considered feral and mostly uncontrollable and also too threatening to Ekerri himself. They are magic resistant, have strong regenerative powers, and can withstand most toxic effects. They can move at very high, supersonic speeds for short distances, change their skin color to match their surroundings, and their claws and teeth are magically enhanced to cut through armor and other materials efficiently and almost effortlessly.</dd><dt>Nüwa</dt><dd>Nüwa are part dragon and part either human or elf. They wildly vary in how much of their body presents as reptilian and how mach as human or elf based on early mosaicization and differentiation. So a Nüwa may be almost entirely dragon or entirely human or elf; or some midpoint between.<ul><li><strong>Kingsnake Tribe</strong> - This tribe of Nüwa reside in a hidden kingdom and serve an Ascended. Almost fully reptilian in form they are marked by their black and white striped coloration. They are considered benign but are rumored to practice infanticide on those that deviate from their reptilian side. Those marked with wings are considered upper caste and elevate the entirety of the family with them.</li></ul></dd><dt>Orc</dt><dd>Orcs range from 190cm to 200cm with less variation than humans. Their skin color will typically change from dusky grey-green to dark grey with age. Eyes typically resemble a cats ranging in color from yellow to green. Orcs lack a nose or ears, instead having holes set in their head. Their teeth are carnivorous, and, like sharks, they will often lose teeth consistently and regrow them. An orc will typically be 20-30% stronger than an equivalently sized human.</dd></dl></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class='container sep-before'></div></footer></article><article lang=en class=entry><div class='container entry-content'></div></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class='prev-entry sep-before'><a title="Previous page in reference" href=/reference/kingdoms/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
