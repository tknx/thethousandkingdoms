This chapter I am always going to say was super hard.

First, I was trying to write a character I can't even say I pretend to understand, a council estates kid in Kennington, London from Brixton. So I am going to completely fuck up the vernacular and regional differences. He is teamed up with a native East Londoner from Kennington and a Brazilian Portuguese girl and they run into a couple Haitian pretwo lwa.

Second, I wanted it to be very *in media res*, but given how fast things go south, I had to move a bunch of stuff up front. Which takes away from starting with them ringing the doorbell and being in the shit.

Third, the use of slang and eye dialects. Eye dialects can come off as super condescending. And I suspect that happens here. Plus I know I am inconsistent with them and come in and out of it. Also Haitian lwa in media have never been presented in a non-derogatory way, and I can't say this chapter isn't guilty of that. And the slang? [UK drill slang from reddit](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj1hLyUyM30AhWeJzQIHf_7D5IQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fukdrill%2Fcomments%2F8wrbzj%2Fuk_drill_slang_cheat_sheet%2F&usg=AOvVaw1HIS1D6pkhJ17rm-5iYQ54), from ["Who They Was" by Gabriel Krauze](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L9GPVN8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B08L9GPVN8&linkCode=as2&tag=tknx02-20&linkId=1bb97b1f11c06ba449fde7f04dcd6f29), and other random sources.

I am thinking about revising the protagonist of this chapter to be a bit more racist and sexist, but frankly I find that to be an even bigger can of worms. And does that mean just because they are poor they have to be that way?

All that being said, I wanted to do this because (1) it shows that what is going on is more widespread than our main storyline. (2) representation is important here and I am trying to navigate not having everyone be an American of  some sort. I expect I will write future interludes all over the world, and am aiming for those to be somewhat sampling proof - meaning expect a lot of Chinese and Indian chapters since they [carry a lot of the world's population](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries). And that is going to be even harder without at least some of the commonalities between the USA and the UK.

So a little more about why I chose this scene. I threw in a reference to a currently popular background TikTok track, should be easy to guess. UK drill seemed to be the best insight into the language of wannabe gangsters. The rap verse I wrote took me a while to write and I am sure it could be better, but it is supposed to be off-the-cuff for Loba and she is good at rhyming only in comparison to Skitz.

And this is a chapter I suspect will get **heavily revised** if I can get some Haitians and UK folks to provide some help to be better.

Fun secret fact about Skitz - he has that name because he over-ate Skittles as a child and threw up rainbow. He thinks it is just a cool name people started calling him years later that he adopted. Loba knew the truth. The real story is that happened to me with Starbust when I was a kid.
