They assume that what was has its own inertia.&rdquo;</p><p>The bridges were full. People on foot running. Trampling one another. Orderly retreat had failed. The day was sunny, it would have been beautiful, even the distortion in the sky above only added to the beauty, like a daytime Aurora Borealis in a place that had never seen one before.</p><p>Eleanor fell to her knees. She was shaking, her eyes blazing with light that was blinding even in the daylight. Blood started from her nose. A trickle.</p><p>&ldquo;Els, stop!&rdquo; cried Charlie.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll hold.&rdquo; Eleanor said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Another hour passed. Charlie took a moment to pull her scarf from her neck and wrap it around her head to protect her eyes. She dabbed at Eleanor&rsquo;s face, wiping sweat and blood off of her face. The trickle of blood from her nose had become a stream. Her tears took on a pink hue. She was trembling. She would have screamed if she could.</p><p>And suddenly her muscles locked and she fell to the ground shaking. Froth coming from her mout as she convulsed.</p><p>&ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; Charlie cried.</p><p>Bahu ran to her goddess and began to check her now dim eyes.</p><p>But the others couldn&rsquo;t help it. They looked upwards as the distortion solidified into a circle, white and cheerful and so very lethal, a second moon.</p><p>There were screams. The people leaving the city became desperate, but there was also, if your ears were very acute, a roaring noise in the distance.</p><p>And as they watched, the minutes passing without notice, the roaring became louder, and it manifested in a wave, a tsunami in the distance rushing towards shore.</p><p>The screams in the distance increased in volume. Jade could make out individuals running toward the cliffs, some carrying their children, others leaving them behind, and some even worse, trampling those in their way.</p><p>And when the wave crashed into the skyscrapers, it was not stopped. They watched the falling towers, swept aside and then under water. It continued on to the floodplain picking up and dashing people against the cliffs that they now stood upon. The roar of water became all.</p><p>Hours later, the waves subsided into the gentle roar of the surf. Bahu was directing the rescue efforts to catch those few that were still alive.</p><p>Eleanor woke up and forced herself onto her hands and knees. &ldquo;How many, how many?&rdquo; And she began to weep.</p><p>All televised to the world as she had promised, foolishly, so long ago.</p><hr><p>Ending:</p><p>&ldquo;I did horrible things&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So what does that mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means you are human. You did well enough. All the old sins are outing themselves. You will have to earn your own forgiveness as will the rest of them. There is no shortcut.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:justify-between -mx-2 mt-4 px-2 pt-4 border-t"><div class="md:text-right mt-4 md:mt-0"></div><div><span class="block font-bold">Next</span>
