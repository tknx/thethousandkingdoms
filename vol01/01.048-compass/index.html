Ella showed up to her courses but couldn&rsquo;t focus. Every topic in class felt like a push towards trying to tie together everything into her newfound understanding of magic.</p><p>She called it her Grander Unified Theory of the universe but it was only true in the sense of Grander, nothing was unified and there was no theory.</p><p>The first class was quantum mechanics. Ella spent the time trying to feel a quark with magic. She could get to the tip of her pen. So not even close. Stats was next and was just too easy to pay any attention to. This one was going to be a drop based on the curriculum.</p><p>She zoned out and then started sending snaps to Charlie who was sitting in the class with her. Charlie and Connor had broken up the night before, and Charlie said she felt freed up, but was still a bit down.</p><p>Knowing Charlie, she would be overcompensating with someone else soon enough.</p><p>Ella walked back to her apartment. The damage from the attack had been cleaned up, a new door installed, the planters patched up. She buzzed herself in and went to the room where she found Jade eating lunch.</p><p>They sat across from one another silently eating.</p><p>&ldquo;So&mldr;,&rdquo; Jade started with, and Ella looked up.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella just flashed a smile and sat back to eat her now cold falafel.</p><p>&ldquo;Ummm&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>Ella looked up expectantly. Jade&rsquo;s face was guarded.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. Maybe let&rsquo;s talk later.&rdquo; Jade picked up her dish and took it to the sink to clean up silently.</p><p>Then she grabbed her bag, tossed on her shoes, and walked out.</p><p>Ella shrugged. She knew Jade was struggling with everything that had happened and was trying to give her rate space.</p><p>The door swung open again and Jade walked over and sat back down.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to talk about this. <i lang=sw title="Damn it. Exclamation.">Jamani</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. You tell me what you want. I don&rsquo;t want to push.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know I almost moved out last week? I packed up some stuff and was about to just.. just&mldr; run away?&rdquo; Jade sounded angry.</p><p>&ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t. Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well how would it look if I ran away and Charlie didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woah. Jade&mldr; don&rsquo;t compare yourself to Charlie. She is not a model of good judgment. For various reasons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know, I know. Charlotte is a bit crazy. But you know she loves you, right?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know. And I need to talk to her. Because if I am being honest, being around me is dangerous. And you both should get away. You don&rsquo;t need to move out, I will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop right there. You don&rsquo;t have to go. And I won&rsquo;t be going either.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why? I don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because. Well lots of reasons. But let me tell you the main one. My grandparents died some forty years ago. They were tortured and executed as political dissidents by the President of Kenya, Daniel Toroitich arap Moi. He was one of those men who the weak follow because they perceive him as being strong and making them strong by association. But really just a venal, power-hungry authoritarian who outstayed his welcome.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella stayed silent. Jade had clearly put some thought into this.</p><p>&ldquo;And then&mldr; I thought, in his early days, he was a teacher. He participated in freeing our country from the British. He must have been a man of ideals once. What happened to that man? Does power corrupt? Or does it expose what was always there?&rdquo;</p><p>Ella waited and then asked. &ldquo;And what was your conclusion?&rdquo;</p><p>Jade did a small half laugh, &ldquo;No idea. How can we know what we ourselves will do when handed power? Much less anyone else?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so&mldr; you are staying to find an answer to that question?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No&mldr; to try and hold to morality. To see that my friend doesn&rsquo;t fall the same way.&rdquo;</p><p>Ella sat back, touched. And then go up and sat next to Jade and gave her a side hug. &ldquo;Thanks Jiminy Cricket.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:justify-between -mx-2 mt-4 px-2 pt-4 border-t"><div class="md:text-right mt-4 md:mt-0"><span class="block font-bold">Previous</span>
