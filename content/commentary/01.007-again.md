This chapter was more difficult to write than the others - lots of establishing new characters and trying to imply familial relationships but with a hopefully light touch. Maybe I crammed too many conversations in here and didn't let each one breathe, but it is a trade-off between endless dialog and moving things along, and in this story, it was just a bit of a breather.

Next chapter will be radically different. 

Also, Ella switching between her American name and Indian name is very intentional. Not sure if I made that too obvious or not obvious enough, or people would be saying who the hell is this person?

We also get the sense that Ella's family is gorgeous - and you would be right. Not sure why I went that way versus average looking.

Also time for a bit of stat reveal on changes since the end of 0.1.1

##### STATS

Ella is getting a mild bonus to several stats after being crowned. +10 to strength, agility and endurance. She is not aware of them yet since she hasn't put them to the test. +10 to charm when dealing with the supernatural as her crowned status makes them slightly more likely to obey.

| Stat | Score | Comments |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Strength | 35 + 10 | |
| Agility | 65 + 10 | |
| Endurance | 65 + 10 | |
| Attractiveness | 75 | She is pretty good-looking |
| Intelligence | 98 | She went to a top K-12 school and is a Physics Ph.D. She should party a bit less to realize her potential |
| Judgment | 50 | She makes good decisions and mediocre ones and bad ones like following Charlie down a subway tunnel - so purely average here |
| Charm | 60 [+ 10] | Only against supernatural entities |
