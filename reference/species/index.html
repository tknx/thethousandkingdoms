Ancient and powerful, these shape-shifting creatures are innately magical and thus survived the sequestering of magic by Ekerri. They were some of Ekerri&rsquo;s most powerful foes. They are natives if the ascendant planes and are now inhabitants on both terrestrial and ascended planes.</p><h3 id=drow>Drow</h3><dl><dt>=======</dt><dt>Drow</dt><dd>Are an earlier experiment of Ekerri&rsquo;s to breed spies and assassins. Because they were meant to run long missions alone, they were imprinted with an absolute fanaticism to Ekerri as their God but it made them inflexible and unimaginative.</dd></dl><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>main</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><dl><dt>Dwarves</dt><dd>Dwarf are 120 to 140cm (4&rsquo; to 4'6) and appear to be roughly chiseled out of stone and rock. Their clans are organized by rough colorations although intermarriage is common. They are agendered and reproduce through some form of recombinative technique that reconstitutes the parents into multiple offspring. They do mate for their lives and will not take another mate.</dd><dt>Elves</dt><dd>Elves often fall within the &ldquo;uncanny valley&rdquo; of being different. Take a human and stretch them vertically. Their cheekbones are very sharp and they have elongated chins giving them triangular faces. Their eyes are canted an uncomfortable looking 30-35 degrees.<ul><li><strong>Huldufólk</strong> - Residing in a Hidden Kingdom that is anchored to our world near Húsavík, Iceland. They are mostly lost to their heritage but have access to disguising magic items to explore the wider world</li></ul></dd><dt>Fae</dt><dd>Fae will typically follow idealized human norms in sizing and appearance, but with metallic skin (gold for summer, silver for winter) and wings. They are fluid in gender and identity, the same fae shifting between both male, female, non-sexual, and hermaphroditic forms; as well as taking on new names that do not often coincide with appearance changes. They will change affiliation between courts in internecine struggles and their skin will change suit. Their wings will ape a variety of normal species such as birds and butterflies and do not shift as the fae changes shape. It is unclear what meaning the wings may have. The fae are notorious for lying through omission, but their social norms are rigorously enforced by other fae.</dd><dt>Keres</dt><dd>Near invisible spirits of the air, they are killers without peer who hunt creatures that have been designated for death. They answer to their Queen, Nyx, but have brokered a deal with Ekerri where they will perform assassinations for him.</dd><dt>Manticore</dt><dd>Human head, lion body, and scorpion tail. Created by Ekerri and infused with significant amounts of magic, it can move very quickly and is very lethal.</dd><dt>Nüwa</dt><dd>Nüwa are part dragon and part either human or elf. They wildly vary in how much of their body presents as reptilian and how mach as human or elf based on early mosaicization and differentiation. So a Nüwa may be almost entirely dragon or entirely human or elf; or some midpoint between.<ul><li><strong>Kingsnake Tribe</strong> - This tribe of Nüwa reside in a hidden kingdom and serve an Ascended. Almost fully reptilian in form they are marked by their black and white striped coloration. They are considered benign but are rumored to practice infanticide on those that deviate from their reptilian side. Those marked with wings are considered upper caste and elevate the entirety of the family with them.</li></ul></dd><dt>Orc</dt><dd>Orcs range from 190cm to 200cm with less variation than humans. Their skin color will change from dusky grey-green to dark grey with age. Eyes typically resemble a cats ranging in color from yellow to green. Orcs lack a nose or ears, instead having holes set in their head. Their teeth are carnivorous, and, like sharks, they will often lose teeth consistently and regrow them. An orc will typically be 20-30% stronger than an equivalently sized human.</dd></dl></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class='container sep-before'></div></footer></article><article lang=en class=entry><div class='container entry-content'></div></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class='prev-entry sep-before'><a title="Previous page in reference" href=/reference/kingdoms/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
