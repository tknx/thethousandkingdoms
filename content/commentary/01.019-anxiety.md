A small reference to Archer, one for the Witcher, and another to Dune. Because why not? Ella is doing what she can while still being in school but she knows it isn't enough. And how do you investigate a secret.  That took me a while to figure out and in the end you need a lead. 

And the paper I linked to, well it is about muons not measuring quite right and that is awesome stuff if you are trying to dig into the fundamentals of the universe. You can read more friendly stuff here in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01251-x). At the time I am writing this, I couldn't find anything to repeat the measurement or confirm it.  So YMMV if this is a cool paper or a false trail.

Also I am not a physicist and my knowledge of physics is terrible. So let me know if there are items I get wrong.
