He was fidgeting with the ring on his finger.
&amp;ldquo;Are we really going to talk about this again? Yes.&amp;rdquo; Ella said. She understood his concern, but part of her wanted to tell him he gave up that right to be possessive when they had broken up. But she knew that was unfair and he was just concerned.</description></item><item><title>01.028 Rainment</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.028-rainment/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 20:20:46 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.028-rainment/</guid><description>Thursday, December 30, 2021 - The Kingdom of the Huldufólk The vanilla custard and almond filling had made her fingers sticky and she looked around the room before just getting up and going to the bathroom sink to wash them off.
She came back and looked disconsolately at the remains of the pastry she had eaten. The pastry Jae-Young had brought back from town. Damn him for breaking up with her so nicely. And then feeding her?</description></item><item><title>01.027 Break</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.027-break/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 20:20:39 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.027-break/</guid><description>Thursday, December 30, 2021 - The Hidden Kingdom of the Huldufólk &amp;ldquo;Look, look,&amp;rdquo; Ella said excitedly, meanwhile, her finger was glowing steadily leaving trails in the air that hung for a moment and dissolved into glittery dust.
Reynard regarded her with wide eyes, &amp;ldquo;How much have you been practicing?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Hmm.&amp;rdquo; She started counting fingers on her other hand using her glowing finger, &amp;ldquo;I get up and go for a run, then shower and breakfast, then practice for three hours&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; she went through the past few days, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; about ten hours a day for the past five days.</description></item><item><title>01.026 Bless Your Heart</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.026-blessyourheart/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 17:50:28 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.026-blessyourheart/</guid><description>Christmas, Saturday 25 December 2021 - Savannah, Georgia, United States Charlie sat glumly on the chaise. Her mother was puttering around adding tinsel to the very oversized Christmas tree before the rest of the family came over and talking about how it was finally perfect. As if she hadn&amp;rsquo;t paid some very expensive professionals to bring in and decorate the tree
Charlie was digging around her purse when she had a happy bit of circumstance happen and she surreptitiously pulled out two forgotten tabs of molly that were sitting in the bottom.</description></item><item><title>01.025 Merry Christmas</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.025-merrychristmas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 17:55:31 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.025-merrychristmas/</guid><description>Friday, December 24, 2021 - Near Húsavík, Iceland &amp;ldquo;So anyway. Are you liking it here? Aren&amp;rsquo;t elves the coolest? You know I was an orphan right? My parents died when I was tiny, fell right down a glacier crevice and were never seen again! And the elves found me wandering near the camp and took me in. And look at me now, it is like a huge family of immortal fairy creatures! And they have so few children they just have no idea what to do with me.</description></item><item><title>01.024 Sitdown</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.024-sitdown/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 17:55:22 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.024-sitdown/</guid><description>Thursday, December 23, 2021 - Near Húsavík, Iceland The both of them followed Jóhanna as she led them down a corridor silently. She walked elegantly, almost floating, but somehow managed to maintain a quick pace.
They entered another room, Jóhanna ducking through the short doorway, and found their bags were already there. It was a small sitting room, like a hotel suite.
&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s sit here&amp;rdquo; and she promptly sat down and gestured to the other two chairs.</description></item><item><title>01.023 Huldufólk</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.023-huldufolk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 17:55:19 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.023-huldufolk/</guid><description>Wednesday, December 22, 2021 - Greenwich Village, New York City, United States Ella looked over her packed bags one more time. She had stripped down and packed them several times to maximize what would carry her the furthest. Waterproofed cold weather hiking boots. Lots of technical and technicolor clothing she had scrounged from friends.
She threw in some notebooks and other random items and called it good.
Jade had already left for the holiday with her brother Craig and a large group who were all going to New Hampshire for skiing.</description></item><item><title>01.022 Coffee</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.022-coffee/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 17:55:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.022-coffee/</guid><description>Friday, December 17, 2021 - Greenwich Village, New York City, United States &amp;ldquo;So I was thinking, the people of Iceland are big into these legends of elves. They think they live in rocks in lava fields and other areas like that.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Right&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; said Ella as she paged through Jae-Young&amp;rsquo;s notes.
&amp;ldquo;Well&amp;hellip; we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be finding cosmopolitan elves hanging around in Reykjavik and running coffee shops and whatever.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Why not? I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have expected one to be a film grad student in New York either!</description></item><item><title>01.021 Reset</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.021-reset/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 17:55:12 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.021-reset/</guid><description>Sunday, November 28, 2021 - Greenwich Village, New York City, United States Ella lay in bed. The sunlight peeked through the drawn curtains and denied her sleep. She was tired after staying up the whole night but her mind kept racing through what she had heard.
She pulled her phone out and started to write notes on it all. And seeing it in print left very few choices.
She typed on her phone quickly and then slowed down as the conclusion became inevitable:</description></item><item><title>01.020 History</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.020-history/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 13:26:29 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.020-history/</guid><description>Sunday, November 28, 2021 - Greenwich Village, New York City, United States &amp;ldquo;Hey lover&amp;hellip; this an early morning booty call?.&amp;rdquo; Ella was relaxed and a bit punchy from staying up all night.
&amp;ldquo;Excuse me?&amp;rdquo; The voice was unfamiliar and Ella quickly looked at her phone. It was a group call.
&amp;ldquo;Ummm&amp;hellip;. Ella, this is my grandfather.&amp;rdquo; Jae-Young&amp;rsquo;s voice broke in. Ella could feel the flush in her face, and she stammered a bit before a greeting.</description></item><item><title>01.019 Anxiety</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.019-anxiety/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 13:26:26 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.019-anxiety/</guid><description>Saturday, November 27, 2021 - Irvington, New Jersey, United States &amp;ldquo;That was awful. Just awful. In all my days teaching, I have never seen anyone worse. Here, you see this?&amp;rdquo; The instructor was pointing to a small origami person he had been folding while Ella had run the course, &amp;ldquo;I could tape a gun to this and it would have been a better run.&amp;rdquo;
Ella just nodded and trembled a bit. She didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything.</description></item><item><title>01.018 Farflung Interests</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.018-farflung/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 13:26:23 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.018-farflung/</guid><description>Saturday, November 27, 2021 - Atacama, Chile &amp;ldquo;Bring the find here,&amp;rdquo; Kothin yelled down the tunnel.
&amp;ldquo;¿Que ?&amp;rdquo; came a voice across the field .
Kothin cursed a bit and then pulled out his phone. After a bit of typing, &amp;ldquo;¡Tráelo aquí!&amp;rdquo;
The workers worked their way over, sloshing right through the intervening brine pool.
&amp;ldquo;Dámelo&amp;rdquo; he said perfunctorily. The workers handed over the lithium slurry. Kothin could feel the mineral composition and after a lot of cursing, references to the translation app, and hand gestures indicated the processing that still needed to take place.</description></item><item><title>01.017 Aqrabuamelu</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.017-aqrabuamelu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 12:19:48 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.017-aqrabuamelu/</guid><description>Ṭebētu, 14 Nabopolassar (January 1, 2921 BCE) - The Hidden Kingdom of Akkad Arcsa tried to lick his dry lips but even his tongue was dry. When Marat had come, he had thought she would perhaps take part of his ration. But he must have looked too weak, and she would not leave any if he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t survive for her to take his next water ration. So she had taken it all. He had fallen so far from grace.</description></item><item><title>01.016 Blooded</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.016-blooded/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 12:19:37 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.016-blooded/</guid><description>Thanksgiving, November 25, 2021 - Jackson Heights, Queens, United States &amp;ldquo;Stop swearing at once!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Alright mom. Now let me and my friends play.&amp;rdquo; Harish&amp;rsquo;s voice was a bit whiny sounding.
&amp;ldquo;I should throw that thing out the door.&amp;rdquo;
Harish kept grumbling while closing the door which intensified when Ella coming around her mother stuck her foot in the way before coming in.
&amp;ldquo;Whatcha doin&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;What do you think I am doing? Playing games with my fam.</description></item><item><title>01.015 Investigation</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.015-investigation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 12:19:17 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.015-investigation/</guid><description>Monday, November 22, 2021 - Greenwich Village, New York, United States Ella felt she was suspicious as she creeped around the Applied Physics lab. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that much of a stretch for her to be here since she was a physicist, but knowing she wanted to use the equipment for non-Ph.D related analysis made her nervous. The professors and students just ignored her.
Eventually she found someone at the door to the room of the SEM.</description></item><item><title>01.014 Punked</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.014-punked/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 15:19:33 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.014-punked/</guid><description>Saturday, November 20, 2021 - Chinatown, New York City, United States Ella fell back. The leg catch and sweep knocking her down.
&amp;ldquo;Damn it.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Get up.&amp;rdquo; Donna&amp;rsquo;s voice was flat. Almost bored sounding. As opposed to the endless punk music screeching from the radio.
They had been here for hours. Donna seemed to take delight in knocking her over. They were mostly sticking to striking since they were in a Muay Thai gym but Donna didn&amp;rsquo;t have problems throwing in hooking moves and other illegal moves.</description></item><item><title>01.013 Sparring</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.013-sparring/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 09:55:10 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.013-sparring/</guid><description>Thursday, 18 November 2021 - Long Island City, Queens, United States &amp;ldquo;Ah shit!&amp;rdquo;
Ell landed on her butt. Breathing hard. Craig stood over her.
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have ever seen anyone improve as quickly as you. You come in every day, work on things until you are collapsing on the ground. You chill out a bit, drink a sports drink, get on the weights and bump up your weight hard for your size. Then you come in the next day bouncy as a bunny with no soreness.</description></item><item><title>01.012 Halloween</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.012-halloween/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:58:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.012-halloween/</guid><description>October 31, 2021 - Long Island City, Queens, United States &amp;ldquo;Hands up!&amp;rdquo; And Craig followed with a flick jab and a &amp;ldquo;gentle&amp;rdquo; body blow.
&amp;ldquo;Ufff&amp;rdquo; Ella completely lost her breath and landed on her ass.
&amp;ldquo;You are strong for your size. And your reflexes are on fire. You also don&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistake twice.&amp;rdquo; He looked at her sitting on the ground, &amp;ldquo;well three times anyway.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Three things for you to work on: You aren&amp;rsquo;t keeping your core tight enough when you strike or defend.</description></item><item><title>01.011 Breathe</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.011-breathe/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 11:01:13 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.011-breathe/</guid><description>October 13, 2021 - Jackson Heights, Queens, United States The following day, she came down in her pajamas after waking up way too early, stretching and yawning. Her brother was already wolfing down cereal with headphones in, head bobbing along to something.
She made her way over, got a bowl of cereal of her own and snagged the milk out of Harish&amp;rsquo;s grasp before he could drink it all.
Heading back up to her room, she started thinking about her final issue which was really the long pole, what was going on and how could she prepare for it better.</description></item><item><title>01.010 Prep</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.010-prep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 21:00:41 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.010-prep/</guid><description>October 12, 2021 - Jackson Heights, Queens, United States Her parents came by to bring her home later that day to take her home. They had brought their car with them to bring her home, the sacrifice of their street parking spot a true sign of love. Her mom still had the shawl wrapped around her which made Ella feel pretty warm inside.
She went into her cozy bedroom that had been split out of a larger bedroom for her and her brother.</description></item><item><title>01.009 Exposition</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.009-exposition/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 13:34:19 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.009-exposition/</guid><description>October 11, 2021 - NYU Langone Hospital, New York City, United States Ella awoke from vivid dreams of strange snake-like creatures with glowing crystalline eyes crawling up her body while she lay trapped under a giant slice of pizza.
She attributed this to the pain meds and being hungry rather than prophecy. How strange her life had become that this was the first thing that came to her.
When she looked up, she almost screamed when she saw a tall thin cadaverous looking man with pale skin, sunken dark eyes, and stringy hair sitting in the hospital room chair.</description></item><item><title>01.008 Interlude - The Wolves of Kennington</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.008-interlude-kennington/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 09:53:13 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.008-interlude-kennington/</guid><description>October 10, 2021 - Mayfair, London, United Kingdom &amp;ldquo;Ballies on, ballers tall, balls deep.&amp;rdquo;
Right fucking poet Skitz was. Thought he and our &amp;ldquo;gang&amp;rdquo; were the next Spartans to come out of Kenny but that was just stupid. Plus he couldn&amp;rsquo;t verse for shit.
I pulled down my mask and checked my ching at my side. &amp;ldquo;Skitz, you gonna duss moment we pound that door.&amp;rdquo;

And then promptly lay back down as her side screamed.
&amp;ldquo;Dhee, where did you learn such language?&amp;rdquo; Her mothers voice, and of course the first thing she said was to nag her, and Eesha had just been stabbed&amp;hellip; for the second time.
Her mother continued reaching over to adjust the sheets. The anodyne beeping of the vital signs monitor and IV cables pretty much gave away the show.</description></item><item><title>01.006 Acceptance</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.006-acceptance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 19:03:42 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.006-acceptance/</guid><description>October 9, 2021 - Bushwick, Brooklyn, United States Ella thought about last night as she pulled on her top. The awkward silence at dinner. Then walking back by his apartment on her way home. Standing across from each other at the entrance.
Grabbing him and kissing him deeply right there. The scrambled wait for the elevator and laughing when some people spilled out and they got in.
Getting undressed and him demurring when she made to pull off that ring.</description></item><item><title>01.005 The Date</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.005-the-date/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:20:40 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.005-the-date/</guid><description>October 8, 2021 - West Village, New York City, United States The following day was a slow burn. She taught her class, graded a ton of terrible exams, and then was supposed to go out. For once it wasn&amp;rsquo;t with Charlie, but she had a date. A film grad student had asked her out a while ago, after meeting her through Jade, and they were finally getting to it&amp;hellip; he was a cute, lanky guy named Jae-Young, or Johnny as he went by.</description></item><item><title>01.004 You Can't Go Back</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.004-you-cant-go-back/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:11:54 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.004-you-cant-go-back/</guid><description>October 7, 2021 - Greenwich Village, New York City, United States After a sleepless night, Ella felt like she was going through the motions. She went to class, spent some time doing math for her grad work, and ate food without noticing what she was eating. Her fellow doctorate students all noticed it but figured she was just hungover and that assessment was reinforced when she excused herself in the afternoon.
Ella actually had determined she would go back to the castle to get answers.</description></item><item><title>01.003 The Party</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.003-the-party/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:10:31 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.003-the-party/</guid><description>October 6, 2021 - Harlem, New York City, United States In the stairwell, Ella&amp;rsquo;s eyes were glowing brilliant white, and &amp;mdash; despite the utter darkness &amp;mdash; she climbed the stairs gracefully up two floors in a serene daze. As she crossed each flight, she didn&amp;rsquo;t notice how her jeans and tunic shirt seemed to shift, into a trailing dress with long velvet gloves, nor, her mask fading away. And then cresting the third floor, a band of light that framed circled her head hinting at a tiara started to form.</description></item><item><title>01.002 One Month Later</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.002-one-month-later/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:09:10 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.002-one-month-later/</guid><description>October 6, 2021 - Harlem, New York City, United States &amp;ldquo;Why do I have to go uptown to study anyway? I know we are just going up there so you can flirt with your boyfriend.&amp;rdquo; Ella whined a bit on the A train as it pulled away from the station.
&amp;ldquo;Shut up&amp;hellip; it isn&amp;rsquo;t that big of a deal and I like to get out of the Village sometimes for a change, you know. Plus it is Thursday night and we can go out afterwards.</description></item><item><title>01.001 Vision</title><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.001-vision/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:05:48 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/01.001-vision/</guid><description>September 9, 2021 - Greenwich Village, New York City, United States &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t go down there.&amp;rdquo;
Charlie looked over and smiled. &amp;ldquo;I hear there are secret tunnels and strange stuff. Let&amp;rsquo;s do this!&amp;rdquo;
She held up her phone showing a picture of something. It was hard to follow as her hand wasn&amp;rsquo;t steady, and Charlie was stumbling a bit anyway.
&amp;ldquo;These aren&amp;rsquo;t yellow bricks, but let&amp;rsquo;s go!&amp;rdquo; Charlie prompted that by jumping down from the platform, her short sparkly, clubbing skirt flaring up as she somehow didn&amp;rsquo;t break the heels she was in.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/maybe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thethousandkingdoms.com/posts/vol01/maybe/</guid><description>Jade came into the room and yelled out, &amp;ldquo;Turn on the news. More weird shit is going on.&amp;rdquo;
She quickly hopped onto her laptop and pulled up the BBC.
&amp;ldquo;What the fuck?&amp;rdquo; Ella whispered.
Jade yelled across the curtain that separate the room. &amp;ldquo;It just showed up about forty five minutes ago. People are freaking out!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Large orbital mass outside lunar orbit detected&amp;hellip; Orbiting Earth&amp;hellip; satellites being pulled off their trajectories?&amp;rdquo; Ella read through the article quickly.</description></item></channel></rss>
