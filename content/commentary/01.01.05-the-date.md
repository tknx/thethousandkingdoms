After the disappointment Ella experienced in her last chapter, I felt like I needed to kickstart the story with more evidence and someone else who maybe knows a little bit more than her. Most YA stories start with the parents dying so nobody can protect or explain what is going on - and the slow reveal is important to build this. But you can be slow, and you can be glacial.

So Jae-Young shows up. A guy who asked her out early on but they only got around to a date now. And, oops, he is also part of this new world.

His balls will never forgive that chair though.
