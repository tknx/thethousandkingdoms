*Charlotte "Charlie" Harris* - Ella's best friend and fellow first-year Physics masters student, but is partying a bit too much since her move up from University of Georgia. From a rich Southern heritage in Savannah of the sort that has debutante balls (which she ditched out of to get drunk and have sex with her boyfriend in her parents car)


*Eesha Eleanor Jindal-Witten* - Our heroine is 5'6" with bronze skin from her half-Indian heritage. Brown eyes naturally and black hair. She starts the story at 25 years old and first-year Physics Ph.D student at NYU.

*Jade Ndereba* - Ella's studio roommate who is Kenyan by descent, tall 5'10" with inky black skin and leaning way into a 1970s style including massive afro. Senior major is Film & Television. A bit conceited as she used to model across Africa, but struggling with not being top of the heap in NYC.
