Now you see the true power of Ella’s very mild enhanced healing. Since this is a rational, progression story with an entirely optional litrpg backbone, I wanted to have a bit of slice of life period showing that she is intensely following up on her action items. So this is part of the training montage for hand-to-hand.

Since I know about fighting than physics expect me to spend more time on those scenes rather than her studying. But at the same time, she has her own responsibilities and life doesn’t stop when the fantastical happens. 

So new stats for her since her strength is way up approaching average male, her agility is reaching pro levels, and her mundane skills are changing a bit too.
